It replaces the older Ecodesign Directive (2009/125/EC) and massively expands its scope — from energy-related products only to nearly all physical goods sold in the EU. The ESPR works through delegated acts: the European Commission adopts product-specific rules covering ecodesign requirements (durability, reparability, recyclability, recycled content) and Digital Product Passport obligations. The first ESPR working plan (2025-2030) prioritises textiles, iron and steel, aluminium, furniture, tyres, detergents, paints, and more. Each delegated act specifies exactly which data attributes the DPP must contain, who is responsible, and when compliance begins — typically 18 months after the act enters into force."

The CPR establishes EU-wide rules for placing construction products on the market based on harmonised technical specifications (harmonised European standards and European Assessment Documents). Chapter X of the new CPR introduces a Digital Product Passport framework for construction products, but specific DPP requirements depend on the development and citation of harmonised standards by CEN/CENELEC, which is ongoing. Regen Studio tracks all 37 product families, their harmonised standards status, and DPP readiness in the CPR DPP Tracker."

          "text": "A design sprint is a time-boxed innovation method — typically 4-5 days — that compresses months of divergent discussion into a structured process: define the challenge, generate solutions, build a testable prototype, and validate it with real users. It is particularly effective when a team is stuck in analysis paralysis, when stakeholders have conflicting visions, or when you need a tangible proof of concept fast. Regen Studio facilitates design sprints for organisations working on complex systemic challenges — energy transition, circular economy, digital identity — where the problem space is large and cross-cutting."

          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">What is a Digital Product Passport (DPP)?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>A Digital Product Passport is a structured digital record that carries product information — materials, origin, environmental impact, repair instructions, and end-of-life options — throughout its lifecycle. Rather than a physical label, a DPP is typically accessed via a QR code or data carrier on the product, linking to a rich set of verified data.</p>
            <p>Several EU regulations mandate DPPs for products sold in the EU. The <a href="blog-post.html?post=espr-textile-delegated-act">Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR)</a> provides the overarching framework, while product-specific regulations — including the EU Battery Regulation, the Toy Safety Regulation, the Detergents Regulation, and the Construction Products Regulation — each introduce their own DPP requirements. The goal is to enable transparency, support circular business models, and empower consumers, recyclers, and regulators with trustworthy product data.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="dpp-faq__item">
          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">Who needs to comply with Digital Product Passport requirements?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>Responsible Economic Operators (REOs) — typically product brands and importers placing products on the EU market — bear the primary compliance obligation. They must ensure a DPP is created and made accessible for each product unit or batch.</p>
            <p>However, DPP compliance is not a solo effort. Supply chain partners (raw material suppliers, component manufacturers, logistics providers) must contribute the underlying data. Technology providers build the systems that host and exchange passport data. And industry associations often coordinate sector-wide approaches to data models and standards. See our <a href="digital-product-passports/#dpp-services">full breakdown by stakeholder type</a>.</p>

          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">Which products need a Digital Product Passport?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>Over 30 product groups are at various stages of requiring a DPP. <strong>Batteries</strong> are the first — the EU Battery Regulation (2023/1542) makes DPPs mandatory from February 2027. Three product-specific regulations have been <strong>adopted</strong> with DPP mandates: <strong>Toys</strong> (Toy Safety Regulation 2025/2509), <strong>Construction Products</strong> (CPR 2024/3110), and <strong>Packaging</strong> (PPWR 2025/40). The revised <strong>Detergents</strong> Regulation is pending formal adoption.</p>
            <p>Under the ESPR, delegated acts are <strong>in preparation</strong> for textiles, iron &amp; steel, aluminium, tyres, washing machines, dishwashers, electronic displays, heaters, and water heaters — with adoption expected by 2027. The <strong>ESPR working plan</strong> (2025–2030) schedules further delegated acts for furniture, mattresses, electric motors, EV chargers, fridges, light sources, cooling equipment, tumble dryers, mobile phones &amp; tablets, and welding equipment.</p>
            <p>Additionally, 19 product groups currently under the Ecodesign Directive — including computers, air conditioners, vacuum cleaners, cooking appliances, ventilation units, solar panels, power transformers, water pumps, and industrial fans — are <strong>transitioning to the ESPR</strong> under Article 79, with new delegated acts (and DPP requirements) expected but not yet scheduled.</p>

          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">What data goes into a Digital Product Passport?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>The specific data requirements depend on the product category and its delegated act, but common elements include: product identification, manufacturer details, materials and substances of concern, carbon footprint, recycled content percentages, durability and reparability scores, disassembly instructions, and end-of-life handling guidance.</p>
            <p>Beyond regulatory minimums, DPPs can carry voluntary data that supports circular business models — such as proof of ethical sourcing, certifications, or dynamic usage data. The <a href="blog-post.html?post=dpp-regenerative-economies">regenerative potential of DPPs</a> lies in going beyond compliance to tell a product's full story.</p>

            <p>We are an independent advisory firm — we don't sell DPP software, build platforms, or take commissions from technology providers. This independence means our advice is always in your interest, not shaped by a product we need to sell.</p>
            <p>We help you understand what you actually need before you buy anything: readiness assessments, compliance roadmaps, data architecture strategy, vendor-neutral technology selection, and organizational change management.

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>The ESPR applies to all products placed on the EU market, regardless of where they are manufactured. This means exporters to the EU — including manufacturers in Brazil, China, Turkey, Bangladesh, and other major production countries — must comply with DPP requirements for their EU-bound products.</p>

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>A DPP readiness assessment is a structured evaluation of an organization's preparedness for Digital Product Passport obligations. Regen Studio's assessment covers:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Regulatory exposure</strong> — which regulations and timelines apply to your products</li>
              <li><strong>Data maturity</strong> — do you already collect the required data points, and in what format</li>
              <li><strong>IT and systems landscape</strong> — where product data lives today and what integration is needed</li>
              <li><strong>Supply chain readiness</strong> — can your suppliers provide the data you need</li>
              <li><strong>Organizational capacity</strong> — who owns DPP compliance internally</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Deliverables typically include a gap analysis, a prioritized compliance roadmap, and recommendations for technology and process changes — all vendor-neutral. Learn more about our <a href="digital-product-passports/#dpp-services">DPP advisory services</a>.</p>

        <details class="dpp-faq__item">
          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">What is the DPP compliance timeline?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>The first DPP deadline is <strong>February 2027</strong>, when the EU Battery Regulation (2023/1542) requires passports for EV batteries, industrial batteries above 2 kWh, and LMT batteries. The Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR 2025/40) introduces DPP elements from <strong>August 2028</strong>. The Toy Safety Regulation (2025/2509) applies from <strong>2030</strong>.</p>
            <p>ESPR delegated acts for textiles are expected in 2026–2027 with application roughly 18 months after adoption. The Construction Products Regulation (2024/3110) DPP timeline depends on harmonised standards development — Chapter X provides the framework but specific dates follow from standardisation progress.</p>
            <p>Organizations should begin data infrastructure work at least 18–24 months before their earliest applicable deadline. See our <a href="digital-product-passports/#dpp-products">product group overview</a> for a visual timeline.</p>

          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">What is the ESPR?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>The Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR, Regulation 2024/1781) is the EU's flagship regulation for making products more sustainable. It replaces the older Ecodesign Directive (2009/125/EC) and massively expands its scope — from energy-related products only to nearly all physical goods sold in the EU.</p>
            <p>The ESPR works through <strong>delegated acts</strong>: the European Commission adopts product-specific rules covering ecodesign requirements (durability, reparability, recyclability, recycled content) and Digital Product Passport obligations. The first ESPR working plan (2025–2030) prioritises textiles, iron &amp; steel, aluminium, furniture, tyres, detergents, paints, and more.</p>
            <p>Each delegated act specifies exactly which data attributes the DPP must contain, who is responsible, and when compliance begins — typically 18 months after the act enters into force.

            <p>The EU Battery Regulation (2023/1542) is the first EU regulation to mandate Digital Product Passports. From <strong>February 2027</strong>, batteries placed on the EU market — including EV batteries, industrial batteries above 2 kWh, and light means of transport (LMT) batteries — must carry a digital passport with over 80 data attributes.</p>
            <p>These cover battery chemistry, capacity, expected lifetime, carbon footprint, recycled content, collection and recycling information, and due diligence data on raw material sourcing. The regulation also introduces a battery carbon footprint declaration, performance and durability requirements, minimum recycled content thresholds (rising over time), and extended producer responsibility.</p>
            <p>It is the most advanced DPP framework currently in force and serves as a reference point for other product categories. Try our <a href="https://demos.regenstudio.space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Battery Passport Checker</a> to assess your obligations.</p>

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>The circular economy is an economic model that eliminates waste by keeping products and materials in use as long as possible — through reuse, repair, remanufacturing, and recycling. Unlike the linear take-make-waste model, a circular approach designs out waste from the start.</p>
            <p>Regen Studio supports the circular economy through <a href="digital-product-passports/">Digital Product Passport advisory</a>, circular business model design, and helping organizations understand how regulation like the ESPR creates both obligations and opportunities.

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>DPPs provide the information needed at every stage of a product's life: what materials are in it, how to repair it, how to disassemble it, and where its components can go next. Without this data, recyclers can't sort efficiently, repair shops can't access service information, and consumers can't make informed choices.</p>
            <p>By making product data transparent and machine-readable, DPPs create the infrastructure for circular business models — from product-as-a-service to take-back schemes.

            <p>Circular business models are alternatives to the traditional sell-and-forget approach. Key models include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Product-as-a-service</strong> — leasing rather than selling, so manufacturers retain ownership and incentive to design for longevity</li>
              <li><strong>Take-back and refurbishment</strong> — collecting used products to restore and resell</li>
              <li><strong>Remanufacturing</strong> — disassembling products to rebuild them to original specifications using a mix of new and recovered parts</li>
              <li><strong>Sharing platforms</strong> — enabling multiple users to access a product without individual ownership</li>
            </ul>

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>The energy transition is the shift from fossil-fuel-based energy systems to renewable, decentralized, and community-governed energy. Regen Studio contributes by designing smart energy communities — local cooperatives that produce, store, and share renewable energy within a neighbourhood or district.</p>
            <p>Our work on projects like <a href="blog-post.html?post=slim-strandnet">Slim Strandnet</a> in Scheveningen (named a top-3 government innovation in the Netherlands in 2025) demonstrates how decentralized grids can solve grid congestion while building community wealth and energy independence.

            <p>Energy communities are citizen-led cooperatives that collectively produce, store, and share renewable energy. Recognized under the EU Clean Energy Package, they allow neighbourhoods, housing associations, or local businesses to jointly invest in solar panels, battery storage, and smart grid infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Benefits include lower energy costs for members, reduced strain on the national grid (by managing local supply and demand), and democratic governance over energy decisions.

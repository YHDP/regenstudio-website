The ESPR working plan schedules further acts for furniture, mattresses, motors, EV chargers, fridges, light sources, cooling equipment, tumble dryers, mobile phones, and welding equipment.

          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">What is a Digital Product Passport (DPP)?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>A Digital Product Passport is a structured digital record that carries product information — materials, origin, environmental impact, repair instructions, and end-of-life options — throughout its lifecycle. Rather than a physical label, a DPP is typically accessed via a QR code or data carrier on the product, linking to a rich set of verified data.</p>
            <p>Several EU regulations mandate DPPs for products sold in the EU. The <a href="blog-post.html?post=espr-textile-delegated-act">Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR)</a> provides the overarching framework, while product-specific regulations — including the EU Battery Regulation, the Toy Safety Regulation, the Detergents Regulation, and the Construction Products Regulation — each introduce their own DPP requirements. The goal is to enable transparency, support circular business models, and empower consumers, recyclers, and regulators with trustworthy product data.</p>

        <details class="dpp-faq__item">
          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">Who needs to comply with Digital Product Passport requirements?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>Responsible Economic Operators (REOs) — typically product brands and importers placing products on the EU market — bear the primary compliance obligation. They must ensure a DPP is created and made accessible for each product unit or batch.</p>
            <p>However, DPP compliance is not a solo effort. Supply chain partners (raw material suppliers, component manufacturers, logistics providers) must contribute the underlying data. Technology providers build the systems that host and exchange passport data. And industry associations often coordinate sector-wide approaches to data models and standards. See our <a href="digital-product-passports/#dpp-services">full breakdown by stakeholder type</a>.</p>

          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">Which products need a Digital Product Passport?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>Over 30 product groups are at various stages of requiring a DPP. <strong>Batteries</strong> are the first — the EU Battery Regulation (2023/1542) makes DPPs mandatory from February 2027. Three product-specific regulations have been <strong>adopted</strong> with DPP mandates: <strong>Toys</strong> (Toy Safety Regulation 2025/2509), <strong>Construction Products</strong> (CPR 2024/3110), and <strong>Packaging</strong> (PPWR 2025/40). The revised <strong>Detergents</strong> Regulation is pending formal adoption.</p>
            <p>Under the ESPR, delegated acts are <strong>in preparation</strong> for textiles, iron &amp; steel, aluminium, tyres, washing machines, dishwashers, electronic displays, heaters, and water heaters — with adoption expected by 2027. The <strong>ESPR working plan</strong> (2025–2030) schedules further delegated acts for furniture, mattresses, electric motors, EV chargers, fridges, light sources, cooling equipment, tumble dryers, mobile phones &amp; tablets, and welding equipment.</p>
            <p>Additionally, 19 product groups currently under the Ecodesign Directive — including computers, air conditioners, vacuum cleaners, cooking appliances, ventilation units, solar panels, power transformers, water pumps, and industrial fans — are <strong>transitioning to the ESPR</strong> under Article 79, with new delegated acts (and DPP requirements) expected but not yet scheduled.</p>

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>The specific data requirements depend on the product category and its delegated act, but common elements include: product identification, manufacturer details, materials and substances of concern, carbon footprint, recycled content percentages, durability and reparability scores, disassembly instructions, and end-of-life handling guidance.</p>
            <p>Beyond regulatory minimums, DPPs can carry voluntary data that supports circular business models — such as proof of ethical sourcing, certifications, or dynamic usage data. The <a href="blog-post.html?post=dpp-regenerative-economies">regenerative potential of DPPs</a> lies in going beyond compliance to tell a product's full story.</p>

          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">What is the circular economy and how does Regen Studio support it?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>The circular economy is an economic model that eliminates waste by keeping products and materials in use as long as possible — through reuse, repair, remanufacturing, and recycling. Unlike the linear take-make-waste model, a circular approach designs out waste from the start.</p>
            <p>Regen Studio supports the circular economy through <a href="digital-product-passports/">Digital Product Passport advisory</a>, circular business model design, and helping organizations understand how regulation like the ESPR creates both obligations and opportunities. We help make circularity practical, not just aspirational.</p>

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>DPPs provide the information needed at every stage of a product's life: what materials are in it, how to repair it, how to disassemble it, and where its components can go next. Without this data, recyclers can't sort efficiently, repair shops can't access service information, and consumers can't make informed choices.</p>
            <p>By making product data transparent and machine-readable, DPPs create the infrastructure for circular business models — from product-as-a-service to take-back schemes.

          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">What is the ESPR and why does it matter?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>The Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) is the EU's flagship regulation for making products more sustainable. It replaces the older Ecodesign Directive and expands its scope far beyond energy-related products to cover nearly all physical goods sold in the EU.</p>
            <p>The ESPR introduces mandatory ecodesign requirements (durability, reparability, recyclability) and Digital Product Passports for each product category through delegated acts. For businesses, it means significant changes to product design, data management, and supply chain transparency. For the planet, it's one of the most ambitious regulatory frameworks for circular economy ever enacted.</p>

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>We offer <a href="innovation-services.html">10 innovation services</a>: problem analysis, ideation, prototyping, solution validation, experiment design, design sprints, innovation process design, innovation system design, innovation coaching, and innovation management.</p>
            <p>Each service is designed for complex multi-stakeholder environments. Our approach doesn't just focus on the creative side — we also account for reporting, decision-making structures, procurement processes, and ethical considerations. We have templates detailing all steps, helping you design innovations and adopt them successfully.</p>

          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">What makes Regen Studio's approach to innovation different?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>Most innovation consultancies optimize for business metrics alone. We design innovations from a systemic perspective — considering technological, social, political, and natural elements together. The most successful innovations that manage to change systems and generate positive impact combine all of these dimensions.</p>
            <p>We also focus specifically on regenerative impact: innovations that don't just reduce harm, but actively restore and improve the systems they touch. Learn more about <a href="index.html#about">our vision</a>.</p>

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>Absolutely. While much of our regulatory work focuses on EU frameworks, our innovation services are location-independent. We have active operations in both the Netherlands and Brazil, and work with clients across Latin America, Europe, and beyond.</p>
            <p>For DPP specifically, we help non-EU manufacturers and exporters prepare for EU market requirements — turning compliance from a burden into a competitive advantage.</p>

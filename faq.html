It replaces the older Ecodesign Directive (2009/125/EC) and massively expands its scope — from energy-related products only to nearly all physical goods sold in the EU. The ESPR works through delegated acts: the European Commission adopts product-specific rules covering ecodesign requirements (durability, reparability, recyclability, recycled content) and Digital Product Passport obligations. The first ESPR working plan (2025-2030) prioritises textiles, iron and steel, aluminium, furniture, tyres, detergents, paints, and more. Each delegated act specifies exactly which data attributes the DPP must contain, who is responsible, and when compliance begins — typically 18 months after the act enters into force."

These cover battery chemistry, capacity, expected lifetime, carbon footprint, recycled content, collection and recycling information, and due diligence data on raw material sourcing. The regulation also introduces a battery carbon footprint declaration, performance and durability requirements, minimum recycled content thresholds (rising over time), and extended producer responsibility.

The CPR establishes EU-wide rules for placing construction products on the market based on harmonised technical specifications (harmonised European standards and European Assessment Documents). Chapter X of the new CPR introduces a Digital Product Passport framework for construction products, but specific DPP requirements depend on the development and citation of harmonised standards by CEN/CENELEC, which is ongoing. Regen Studio tracks all 37 product families, their harmonised standards status, and DPP readiness in the CPR DPP Tracker."

It introduces recycled content targets, restrictions on certain single-use packaging formats, mandatory reuse systems for specific sectors, and DPP-like digital labelling requirements. From August 2028, packaging must carry a data carrier (such as a QR code) linking to information about material composition, recyclability, and proper sorting.

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>Regenerative innovation goes beyond sustainability — instead of just reducing harm, it actively restores and improves the systems it touches. Where sustainable design aims to do less bad, regenerative design asks: how can this innovation leave communities, ecosystems, and economies in a better state than before?</p>
            <p>At Regen Studio, this means designing innovations that create positive feedback loops — a <a href="/blog/slim-strandnet/">smart energy grid</a> that reduces carbon emissions <em>and</em> builds community wealth, or a <a href="/blog/dpp-regenerative-economies/">Digital Product Passport system</a> that enables both regulatory compliance <em>and</em> new circular business models.

          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">What is the ESPR?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>The Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR, Regulation 2024/1781) is the EU's flagship regulation for making products more sustainable. It replaces the older Ecodesign Directive (2009/125/EC) and massively expands its scope — from energy-related products only to nearly all physical goods sold in the EU.</p>
            <p>The ESPR works through <strong>delegated acts</strong>: the European Commission adopts product-specific rules covering ecodesign requirements (durability, reparability, recyclability, recycled content) and Digital Product Passport obligations. The first ESPR working plan (2025–2030) prioritises textiles, iron &amp; steel, aluminium, furniture, tyres, detergents, paints, and more.</p>
            <p>Each delegated act specifies exactly which data attributes the DPP must contain, who is responsible, and when compliance begins — typically 18 months after the act enters into force. Read our analysis of the <a href="/blog/espr-textile-delegated-act/">expected textile delegated act</a> for a practical example.</p>

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>The EU Battery Regulation (2023/1542) is the first EU regulation to mandate Digital Product Passports. From <strong>February 2027</strong>, batteries placed on the EU market — including EV batteries, industrial batteries above 2 kWh, and light means of transport (LMT) batteries — must carry a digital passport with over 80 data attributes.</p>
            <p>These cover battery chemistry, capacity, expected lifetime, carbon footprint, recycled content, collection and recycling information, and due diligence data on raw material sourcing. The regulation also introduces a battery carbon footprint declaration, performance and durability requirements, minimum recycled content thresholds (rising over time), and extended producer responsibility.</p>
            <p>It is the most advanced DPP framework currently in force and serves as a reference point for other product categories. Try our <a href="https://demos.regenstudio.world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Battery Passport Checker</a> to assess your obligations.</p>

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>The new Construction Products Regulation (2024/3110) replaces the original CPR (305/2011) and covers <strong>37 product families</strong> — from cement and concrete to insulation, doors, chimneys, and structural timber. The CPR establishes EU-wide rules for placing construction products on the market based on harmonised technical specifications (harmonised European standards and European Assessment Documents).</p>
            <p>Chapter X of the new CPR introduces a Digital Product Passport framework for construction products, but specific DPP requirements depend on the development and citation of harmonised standards by CEN/CENELEC, which is ongoing. Regen Studio tracks all 37 product families, their harmonised standards status, and DPP readiness in the <a href="https://demos.regenstudio.world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPR DPP Tracker</a>.

It introduces recycled content targets, restrictions on certain single-use packaging formats, mandatory reuse systems for specific sectors, and DPP-like digital labelling requirements.</p>
            <p>From <strong>August 2028</strong>, packaging must carry a data carrier (such as a QR code) linking to information about material composition, recyclability, and proper sorting. While not a full DPP in the ESPR sense, the PPWR's digital information requirements create similar compliance challenges around data collection, labelling, and supply chain coordination.</p>

          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">What is the circular economy and how does Regen Studio support it?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>The circular economy is an economic model that eliminates waste by keeping products and materials in use as long as possible — through reuse, repair, remanufacturing, and recycling. Unlike the linear take-make-waste model, a circular approach designs out waste from the start.</p>
            <p>Regen Studio supports the circular economy through <a href="digital-product-passports/">Digital Product Passport advisory</a>, circular business model design, and helping organisations understand how regulation like the ESPR creates both obligations and opportunities.

          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">What is a Digital Product Passport (DPP)?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>A Digital Product Passport is a structured digital record that carries product information — materials, origin, environmental impact, repair instructions, and end-of-life options — throughout its lifecycle. Rather than a physical label, a DPP is typically accessed via a QR code or data carrier on the product, linking to a rich set of verified data.</p>
            <p>Several EU regulations mandate DPPs for products sold in the EU. The <a href="/blog/espr-textile-delegated-act/">Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR)</a> provides the overarching framework, while product-specific regulations — including the EU Battery Regulation, the Toy Safety Regulation, the Detergents Regulation, and the Construction Products Regulation — each introduce their own DPP requirements. The goal is to enable transparency, support circular business models, and empower consumers, recyclers, and regulators with trustworthy product data.</p>

        <details class="dpp-faq__item">
          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">How do Digital Product Passports enable the circular economy?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>DPPs provide the information needed at every stage of a product's life: what materials are in it, how to repair it, how to disassemble it, and where its components can go next. Without this data, recyclers can't sort efficiently, repair shops can't access service information, and consumers can't make informed choices.</p>
            <p>By making product data transparent and machine-readable, DPPs create the infrastructure for circular business models — from product-as-a-service to take-back schemes. Read more about <a href="/blog/dpp-regenerative-economies/">how DPPs can drive regenerative economies</a>.</p>

          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">Who needs to comply with Digital Product Passport requirements?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>Responsible Economic Operators (REOs) — typically product brands and importers placing products on the EU market — bear the primary compliance obligation. They must ensure a DPP is created and made accessible for each product unit or batch.</p>
            <p>However, DPP compliance is not a solo effort. Supply chain partners (raw material suppliers, component manufacturers, logistics providers) must contribute the underlying data. Technology providers build the systems that host and exchange passport data. And industry associations often coordinate sector-wide approaches to data models and standards.

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>Over 30 product groups are at various stages of requiring a DPP. <strong>Batteries</strong> are the first — the EU Battery Regulation (2023/1542) makes DPPs mandatory from February 2027. Three product-specific regulations have been <strong>adopted</strong> with DPP mandates: <strong>Toys</strong> (Toy Safety Regulation 2025/2509), <strong>Construction Products</strong> (CPR 2024/3110), and <strong>Packaging</strong> (PPWR 2025/40). The revised <strong>Detergents</strong> Regulation is pending formal adoption.</p>
            <p>Under the ESPR, delegated acts are <strong>in preparation</strong> for textiles, iron &amp; steel, aluminium, tyres, washing machines, dishwashers, electronic displays, heaters, and water heaters — with adoption expected by 2027. The <strong>ESPR working plan</strong> (2025–2030) schedules further delegated acts for furniture, mattresses, electric motors, EV chargers, fridges, light sources, cooling equipment, tumble dryers, mobile phones &amp; tablets, and welding equipment.</p>
            <p>Additionally, 19 product groups currently under the Ecodesign Directive — including computers, air conditioners, vacuum cleaners, cooking appliances, ventilation units, solar panels, power transformers, water pumps, and industrial fans — are <strong>transitioning to the ESPR</strong> under Article 79, with new delegated acts (and DPP requirements) expected but not yet scheduled.</p>

            <p>The first DPP deadline is <strong>February 2027</strong>, when the EU Battery Regulation (2023/1542) requires passports for EV batteries, industrial batteries above 2 kWh, and LMT batteries. The Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR 2025/40) introduces DPP elements from <strong>August 2028</strong>. The Toy Safety Regulation (2025/2509) applies from <strong>2030</strong>.</p>
            <p>ESPR delegated acts for textiles are expected in 2026–2027 with application roughly 18 months after adoption. The Construction Products Regulation (2024/3110) DPP timeline depends on harmonised standards development — Chapter X provides the framework but specific dates follow from standardisation progress.</p>
            <p>Organisations should begin data infrastructure work at least 18–24 months before their earliest applicable deadline. See our <a href="digital-product-passports/#dpp-products">product group overview</a> for a visual timeline.</p>

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>Circular business models are alternatives to the traditional sell-and-forget approach. Key models include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Product-as-a-service</strong> — leasing rather than selling, so manufacturers retain ownership and incentive to design for longevity</li>
              <li><strong>Take-back and refurbishment</strong> — collecting used products to restore and resell</li>
              <li><strong>Remanufacturing</strong> — disassembling products to rebuild them to original specifications using a mix of new and recovered parts</li>
              <li><strong>Sharing platforms</strong> — enabling multiple users to access a product without individual ownership</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Digital Product Passports are a key enabler — they provide the material composition, disassembly instructions, and lifecycle data that make these models operationally viable at scale. Read more about <a href="/blog/dpp-regenerative-economies/">DPPs and regenerative economies</a>.</p>

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>The energy transition is the shift from fossil-fuel-based energy systems to renewable, decentralized, and community-governed energy. Regen Studio contributes by designing smart energy communities — local cooperatives that produce, store, and share renewable energy within a neighbourhood or district.</p>
            <p>Our work on projects like <a href="/blog/slim-strandnet/">Slim Strandnet</a> in Scheveningen (named a top-3 government innovation in the Netherlands in 2025) demonstrates how decentralized grids can solve grid congestion while building community wealth and energy independence.

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>Energy communities are citizen-led cooperatives that collectively produce, store, and share renewable energy. Recognized under the EU Clean Energy Package, they allow neighbourhoods, housing associations, or local businesses to jointly invest in solar panels, battery storage, and smart grid infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Benefits include lower energy costs for members, reduced strain on the national grid (by managing local supply and demand), and democratic governance over energy decisions. Regen Studio has designed energy community models for <a href="/blog/slim-strandnet/">Scheveningen beach (Slim Strandnet)</a> and other neighbourhoods in The Hague.</p>

            <p>Energy justice is the principle that the costs and benefits of energy systems should be distributed equitably — not just among those who can afford solar panels or EV chargers.

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>A digital identity is the collection of attributes, credentials, and identifiers that represent a person, organisation, or thing in the digital world. It is how you prove who you are online — whether logging into a service, signing a document, or verifying your age.</p>
            <p>Unlike traditional identity systems that rely on centralized databases controlled by governments or companies, modern digital identity frameworks — such as those emerging under <a href="/blog/ssi-privacy/">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> and eIDAS 2.0 — give individuals direct control over their own data through digital wallets and verifiable credentials.</p>

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>eIDAS 2.0 (Regulation EU 2024/1183) is the revised European framework for electronic identification and trust services. It updates the original 2014 eIDAS regulation with a much broader scope and a new centerpiece: the European Digital Identity Wallet.</p>
            <p>Under eIDAS 2.0, all EU member states must offer citizens a wallet by 2026 that enables cross-border identity verification, selective disclosure of personal attributes (proving you're over 18 without revealing your date of birth), and qualified electronic signatures — all under the user's control. Large online platforms will be required to accept these wallets for authentication.</p>

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>A European Digital Identity wallet is a secure app that allows EU citizens to store and share verified identity credentials — such as a driving licence, diploma, or proof of address — digitally, under their own control. Mandated by the revised eIDAS 2.0 Regulation, EDI wallets use <strong>selective disclosure</strong>: you share only the specific data points needed (for example, proving you are over 18 without revealing your birth date).</p>
            <p>Regen Studio has built an <a href="https://demos.regenstudio.world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interactive prototype of an EDI wallet</a> to demonstrate how selective disclosure and credential management work in practice.

          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">What is Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>Self-Sovereign Identity is a model where individuals own and control their digital identity without depending on a central authority. Instead of a platform or government holding your data and deciding what to share, you hold cryptographically signed credentials in your own wallet and choose when and with whom to share them.</p>
            <p>SSI relies on technologies like <strong>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</strong> and <strong>Verifiable Credentials</strong> to enable trust without centralization. It underpins many of the principles embedded in eIDAS 2.0, though critics note that EDI wallets are issued by member states — not self-created — so the EU framework stops short of full decentralization while preserving the core principles of selective disclosure and user control.

          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">What are Verifiable Credentials?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>Verifiable Credentials are tamper-proof, cryptographically signed digital statements issued by a trusted party. They can represent anything from a university diploma to a proof of address to a professional license. The holder stores them in a digital wallet and can present them to verifiers — who can check their authenticity instantly without contacting the issuer.</p>
            <p>This is a core building block of both eIDAS 2.0 and Self-Sovereign Identity. Combined with selective disclosure, verifiable credentials allow you to prove specific claims (e.g., "I am over 18") without revealing the underlying data (your full date of birth). Try it yourself in our <a href="/blog/demo-edi-wallet/">EDI Wallet demo</a>.</p>

          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">What is selective disclosure?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>Selective disclosure is the ability to share only specific attributes from a credential without revealing the full underlying data. For example, proving you are over 18 without revealing your exact date of birth, or proving you hold a valid driver's licence without sharing your home address.</p>
            <p>This is a fundamental privacy mechanism in eIDAS 2.0 wallets and SSI systems. It is made possible through cryptographic techniques that allow a verifier to confirm a claim is true — signed by a trusted issuer — without seeing the data that isn't relevant to the interaction. Our <a href="https://demos.regenstudio.world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EDI Wallet demo</a> lets you experience selective disclosure in practice.</p>

            <p>Digital Product Passports need trust — how do you know the data in a passport is authentic and hasn't been tampered with? This is where digital identity infrastructure comes in.

            <p>Privacy-by-Design is a design approach where privacy protections are built into systems from the start, not bolted on after. In digital identity, this means selective disclosure, data minimization, and ensuring users share only what is strictly necessary for each interaction.</p>

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>Regen Studio hosts five interactive demos at <a href="https://demos.regenstudio.world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demos.regenstudio.world</a>. Three are freely accessible:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Battery Passport Checker</strong> — a quick DPP obligation assessment for battery producers</li>
              <li><strong>AI Tax &rarr; UBI</strong> — a policy simulation exploring how AI taxation could fund universal basic income</li>
              <li><strong>CPR DPP Tracker</strong> — tracking all 37 construction product families and their standards progress</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Two are restricted and available on request:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>DPP System</strong> — a full product passport platform prototype showing lifecycle data management</li>
              <li><strong>EDI Wallet</strong> — a European Digital Identity wallet prototype demonstrating selective disclosure</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The demos are designed to make abstract regulatory concepts tangible and testable.</p>

          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">What is the CPR DPP Tracker?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>The <a href="https://demos.regenstudio.world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPR DPP Tracker</a> is an interactive tool that maps the DPP readiness of all 37 product families under the Construction Products Regulation (2024/3110). For each family, it shows the relevant harmonised European standards (hENs), European Assessment Documents (EADs), standardisation request status, and estimated DPP timeline.</p>
            <p>The tracker is updated monthly as CEN/CENELEC standards progress. The same research is available as a comprehensive <strong>paid PDF report</strong> — a 200-plus page reference document with detailed per-family analysis, timeline visualisations, and regulatory cross-references.

          <summary class="dpp-faq__question">What is the Battery Passport Checker?</summary>
          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>The <a href="https://demos.regenstudio.world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Battery Passport Checker</a> is a free online tool that helps battery producers, importers, and brands determine their Digital Product Passport obligations under the EU Battery Regulation (2023/1542).</p>
            <p>In about one minute, users answer questions about their battery type (EV, industrial, LMT, portable, SLI), capacity, and market placement — and receive a personalised assessment of which DPP requirements apply and when. The tool generates a downloadable PDF summary covering all battery categories defined in the regulation.</p>

          <div class="dpp-faq__answer">
            <p>The DPP System and EDI Wallet demos are password-protected because they contain detailed prototype functionality that benefits from a guided walkthrough. To request access, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@regenstudio.world">info@regenstudio.world</a> or use the <a href="#faq-contact">contact form below</a>. We'll schedule a brief introduction to walk you through the demo and discuss how the concepts apply to your organisation.</p>

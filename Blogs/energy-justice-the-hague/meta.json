  "excerpt": "The Hague tested whether solar cooperative revenues from Slim Strandnet could be routed directly to people in need — reducing energy bills without requiring them to join a cooperative. Behind the experiment lies a larger vision: a city-wide social cooperative that ensures energy security and independence for everyone, regardless of whether they can afford a solar panel. Inside the design, the experiment, and what it takes to make the energy transition structurally just.",

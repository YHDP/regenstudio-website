<p>Digital identity is broken. Most systems today ask you to hand over all your personal data to verify a single fact — your age, your professional qualification, your citizenship. The result is a surveillance economy where personal data is the price of participation. The EDI Wallet demo shows a different path: a privacy-first identity wallet where <em>you</em> decide what you share, when, and with whom.</p>

<h2>Why Digital Identity Needs a Privacy-First Rethink</h2>

<p>The EU's <strong>eIDAS 2.0 regulation</strong> (EU 2024/1183) introduces the European Digital Identity Wallet — a mandatory framework for all EU member states to offer their citizens a digital wallet for identity credentials. The regulation requires that wallets support selective disclosure, meaning a user can prove a specific attribute (such as being over 18) without revealing the underlying credential (their full date of birth and other personal details).</p>

<p>This is a fundamental shift. Instead of centralised identity providers that hold your data and mediate every verification, eIDAS 2.0 wallets enable peer-to-peer credential exchange — between a person and a service, or between organisations.</p>

<p>The EDI Wallet demo makes this tangible. Rather than reading about verifiable credentials and selective disclosure, you experience them.</p>

<h2>What the Demo Shows</h2>

<p>The demo simulates a complete SSI wallet interaction cycle:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Credential issuance:</strong> A credential issuer (such as a university, government agency, or employer) issues a verifiable credential to your wallet. You see the credential's structure — the claims it contains, the issuer's digital signature, and the expiry.</li>
  <li><strong>Credential storage:</strong> The credential is stored in your wallet, organised and accessible. You control which credentials are in your wallet and can revoke or delete them.</li>
  <li><strong>Credential presentation with selective disclosure:</strong> When a verifier (a service or organisation) requests proof, you choose exactly which attributes to share. The wallet generates a cryptographic proof that satisfies the verifier's request without revealing anything beyond what you chose to disclose.</li>
  <li><strong>QR-based presentation flow:</strong> The demo includes a realistic QR scanning flow — the mechanism used in real-world eIDAS 2.0 interactions — so you can see how in-person and online verification works in practice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who It Is For</h2>

<p><strong>Identity architects and developers</strong> building digital identity systems, wallet applications, or verifier integrations will get hands-on familiarity with the SSI interaction model and understand how eIDAS 2.0 compliance requirements translate to real implementation choices.</p>

<p><strong>Government digital teams</strong> working on national eIDAS 2.0 wallet implementations or digital service transformation will find the demo a useful reference point for what a compliant wallet interaction looks and feels like from the user's perspective.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy researchers and data protection officers</strong> can use the demo to understand how selective disclosure works in practice — and how it differs from the consent-based data minimisation approaches that most current systems use.</p>

<p><strong>Product managers and UX designers</strong> building services that will need to accept eIDAS 2.0 wallet credentials can explore the verification flow and understand what their users will experience on the wallet side of the interaction.</p>

<h2>How to Use the Demo</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Enter through the gate.</strong> Provide your name and organisation to access the demo environment. No account or special software is required.</li>
  <li><strong>Receive a credential.</strong> The demo issues a verifiable credential to your simulated wallet — for example, a professional qualification or an age verification credential. You can inspect the credential's structure and the issuer's attestation.</li>
  <li><strong>Store it in your wallet.</strong> The credential is added to your wallet. Explore the wallet interface to see how credentials are organised and what information is displayed to the holder.</li>
  <li><strong>Scan a QR code to present.</strong> Navigate to a verifier scenario and scan the QR code to trigger a presentation request. The wallet will show you exactly what the verifier is asking for.</li>
  <li><strong>Choose what to disclose.</strong> Select which attributes to share in response to the verifier's request. The wallet generates a selective disclosure proof — and you can see what the verifier receives versus what remains private in your wallet.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024R3110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Construction Products Regulation (EU) 2024/3110</a> introduces a Digital Product Passport (DPP) framework in Chapter X (Articles 75–80) that will eventually cover all construction products placed on the EU market with a CE mark. Most industry analysis focuses on the family-by-family rollout driven by the Commission's Working Plan and the development of new harmonised technical specifications. But this framing misses a critical structural feature of the regulation: <strong>DPP obligations are triggered per standard, not per product family — and the two parallel routes to CE marking create a timing paradox that could catch innovative manufacturers off guard.</strong></p>

<h2>Two Routes to CE Marking</h2>

<p>Construction products reach CE marking through one of two routes under EU law. Understanding both is essential to understanding why DPP obligations will not arrive uniformly.</p>

<h3>Route 1: Harmonised standards (hENs)</h3>

<p>The vast majority of construction products are covered by <strong>harmonised European standards</strong> (hENs) — technical specifications developed by CEN Technical Committees under a formal Commission mandate and cited in the Official Journal of the EU. If a product falls within the scope of a cited hEN, CE marking is mandatory. Today, there are approximately <strong>440+ harmonised standards</strong> across the 37 product families defined in Annex VII of the CPR.</p>

<p>Under CPR 2024/3110, each existing hEN will eventually be replaced by a new <strong>Harmonised Technical Specification (HTS)</strong>. The Commission's <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2025:772:FIN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working Plan (COM(2025) 772)</a> tracks six milestones per product family, typically spanning 4.5–5.5 years from preparatory work to enforceable standard:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Milestone I</strong> — Product scope definition (~6 months)</li>
  <li><strong>Milestone III</strong> — Essential characteristics defined (~6 months)</li>
  <li><strong>Standardisation request (SReq) adopted</strong> — Formal mandate to CEN/CENELEC</li>
  <li><strong>Standard development by TC</strong> (~36 months)</li>
  <li><strong>Delegated act making standard mandatory</strong> (~6 months)</li>
  <li><strong>Coexistence period</strong> (12–24 months)</li>
</ol>

<p>A crucial detail: the standardisation request sets <strong>individual deadlines for each standard</strong> within its scope — not a single blanket date. An SReq may cover 15 hENs across a product family, each with its own delivery date reflecting the complexity and state of readiness of the underlying standard. This means products within the same family will transition to new HTS at different times.</p>

<h3>Route 2: European Assessment Documents (EADs) and European Technical Assessments (ETAs)</h3>

<p>When no harmonised standard covers a product — typically because it is innovative, niche, or uses novel materials or construction methods — a manufacturer can request a <strong>European Technical Assessment (ETA)</strong>. The ETA is based on a <strong>European Assessment Document (EAD)</strong> developed by <a href="https://www.eota.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EOTA</a> (European Organisation for Technical Assessment). This is a voluntary route: no manufacturer is obliged to seek an ETA, but many do because it provides the only path to CE marking for products outside the scope of harmonised standards.</p>

<p>The EAD/ETA route covers a substantial and growing part of the construction products market. There are currently over <strong>500 EADs</strong> in EOTA's database, and some product families rely heavily or exclusively on them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Building Kits (KAS)</strong> — ~32 EADs, zero harmonised standards. The entire family is EAD-based.</li>
  <li><strong>Fire-stopping, fire-sealing and fire-protective products (FFF)</strong> — ~73 EADs, the highest of any family.</li>
  <li><strong>Roof Coverings (ROC)</strong> — 21 hENs alongside 32 EADs, covering green roof kits, BIPV systems, and other innovations.</li>
  <li><strong>Concrete, Mortar and Grout (CMG)</strong> — 16 hENs plus 19 EADs, including circularity innovations like steel fibres from recycled tyres and municipal waste incinerator bottom ash aggregate.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The DPP Trigger: DoPC, Not Family Membership</h2>

<p>Here is the critical legal mechanism that most industry analysis overlooks. DPP obligations under Chapter X of CPR 2024/3110 are linked to the <strong>Declaration of Performance and Conformity (DoPC)</strong> — the new version of the declaration that replaces the old Declaration of Performance (DoP) from CPR 305/2011.</p>

<p>The logic is binary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A product that issues a <strong>DoPC</strong> under CPR 2024/3110 falls under Chapter X → <strong>DPP required</strong> (once the Article 75 delegated act is in force).</li>
  <li>A product that still issues a <strong>DoP</strong> under CPR 305/2011 → <strong>no DPP obligation</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both routes lead to a DoPC:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Route 1 (hEN):</strong> A product covered by a <strong>new HTS</strong> adopted under CPR 2024/3110 must issue a DoPC.</li>
  <li><strong>Route 2 (EAD/ETA):</strong> A product with a <strong>new ETA</strong> issued against an EAD adopted under CPR 2024/3110 must issue a DoPC.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no third category. There is no exemption for products "between" routes. The DoPC is the universal gate.</p>

<h2>The Innovator's Paradox</h2>

<p>This is where the timing becomes paradoxical. The two routes operate on fundamentally different timescales:</p>

<p>The paradox: a manufacturer of an innovative green roof kit, structural building system, or novel insulation product could obtain a new ETA under a CPR 2024/3110 EAD and be required to issue a DoPC — triggering DPP obligations — <strong>years before</strong> the mainstream products in the same family have their harmonised standards replaced. The clay roof tile manufacturer, the standard concrete block producer, and the conventional mineral wool insulation maker all continue under their old hENs (and old DoPs) while the innovator is already operating under the full DPP regime.</p>

<h2>There Is No Loophole</h2>

<p>Some in the industry may assume that if no standardisation request (SReq) covers their product, or if their product is "only" covered by an EAD rather than a harmonised standard, they might escape DPP obligations. This is incorrect.</p>

<p>The SReq system — through which the Commission mandates CEN/CENELEC to develop new HTS — only applies to Route 1 (hENs). SReqs set individual deadlines per standard within their scope, defined in the standardisation request's Annex I. But <strong>SReqs do not cover EADs</strong>. The EAD route operates through EOTA under a completely separate governance structure.</p>

<p>This separation does not create an escape route — it eliminates one. Consider the following scenarios:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Product covered by an hEN:</strong> DPP applies once the hEN is replaced by a new HTS → DoPC → DPP.</li>
  <li><strong>Product covered by an EAD/ETA:</strong> DPP applies once a new EAD is adopted under CPR 2024/3110 and the manufacturer obtains a new ETA → DoPC → DPP.</li>
  <li><strong>Product with no applicable standard at all:</strong> Cannot obtain CE marking under the CPR → no market access for regulated construction products in the EU.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every product that wants to be on the EU market with a CE mark under the CPR will eventually issue a DoPC — and with it, a DPP. The only variable is <em>when</em>, not <em>whether</em>.</p>

<h2>The EAD Transition Timeline</h2>

<p>The regulation sets clear deadlines for the transition of EADs from the old to the new regime:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Old EADs</strong> (adopted under CPR 305/2011) remain valid for issuing new ETAs <strong>until 2030</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>ETAs issued under old EADs</strong> remain valid for CE marking <strong>until 2035</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>New EADs</strong> under CPR 2024/3110 must include <strong>environmental sustainability requirements</strong>: Global Warming Potential (GWP) declaration from day one, core life cycle assessment by 2029, and full LCA by 2031.</li>
  <li>New EADs have a <strong>10-year validity period</strong>. ETAs issued under new EADs have <strong>no expiry</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This creates a clear clock. After 2030, no new ETAs can be issued under old EADs. Manufacturers who need new or renewed ETAs will have no choice but to use new EADs — which trigger the DoPC — which triggers DPP. By 2035 at the latest, all old ETAs expire, and every EAD-route product on the market will be under the new regime.</p>

<h2>What This Means for Industry</h2>

<p>The practical implications cut across the entire construction value chain:</p>

<h3>For innovative manufacturers (EAD/ETA users)</h3>

<p>If you are planning to request a new ETA or renew an existing one after CPR 2024/3110 fully applies, you should prepare for DPP obligations on a <strong>shorter timeline than the family-level estimates suggest</strong>. Your DPP readiness depends not on when your product family's hENs are replaced, but on when EOTA adopts a new EAD applicable to your product and on when the Article 75 delegated act enters into force. Both could converge as early as 2028–2029.</p>

<h3>For mainstream manufacturers (hEN users)</h3>

<p>The family-level DPP estimates (2029–2034 depending on the wave) still apply for hEN-route products. But be aware that DPP infrastructure and regulatory expectations will already be established through EAD-route early movers within your own product family. By the time your HTS is in force, DPP will not be a greenfield exercise — it will be an operational system with established practices, service providers, and enforcement precedents.</p>

<h3>For Technical Assessment Bodies (TABs) and EOTA</h3>

<p>EOTA's role becomes even more significant under the new CPR. Every new EAD adopted under CPR 2024/3110 effectively triggers the DPP clock for the products it covers. TABs will need to ensure that new EADs incorporate the sustainability requirements (GWP, LCA) that are prerequisites for meaningful DPP data — and that the assessment process supports the data generation that DPPs require.</p>

<h3>For the Commission and standardisation bodies</h3>

<p>The per-standard granularity of DPP activation means that the sequencing of SReqs and the prioritisation of standards within each SReq directly affect which manufacturers face DPP obligations first. This is a policy lever: prioritising standards for high-impact product categories (by volume, environmental footprint, or market significance) can shape the practical rollout of the DPP in ways that the family-level Working Plan does not capture.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>The construction industry's discussion of DPP timelines has been anchored in product families and Commission Working Plan waves. This framing is useful but incomplete. The real trigger for DPP obligations is the <strong>Declaration of Performance and Conformity</strong> — and the two parallel routes to CE marking (hEN and EAD) mean that DPP obligations will arrive at different times for different products within the same family. The innovator's paradox — where EAD-route products face DPP before their hEN-route siblings — is not a bug in the regulation. It is a structural consequence of the two-route system that the industry needs to plan for.</p>

<p>There is no loophole. There is no exemption. There is only a question of timing.</p>

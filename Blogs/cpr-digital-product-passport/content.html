<p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024R3110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Construction Products Regulation (EU) 2024/3110</a> — the recast of the original CPR 305/2011 — is one of the most significant pieces of EU internal market legislation for the construction sector in over a decade. Among its many innovations, it introduces a full Digital Product Passport (DPP) framework for construction products, set out in Chapter X (Articles 75–80). In this article, we walk through the legislative timeline, the DPP provisions, the critical role of harmonised standards, and what the Commission's Working Plan tells us about when different product families will actually be affected.</p>

<h2>Legislative Timeline</h2>

<p>The path from proposal to applicable regulation took nearly four years:</p>

</figure>

<h2>Where the DPP Lives in the CPR — Chapter X</h2>

<p>The DPP provisions are concentrated in Chapter X of the regulation, spanning Articles 75 to 80. Unlike the ESPR, which delegates DPP details almost entirely to product-specific delegated acts, the CPR recast builds a substantial DPP framework directly into the regulation text:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Article 75</strong> — Establishes the DPP system. The Commission is empowered to adopt a <strong>delegated act</strong> setting out the technical design of the DPP system for construction products. In practice, it is expected that this delegated act will likely be adopted after the <a href="https://www.cencenelec.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEN/CENELEC</a> JTC24 working groups have published the DPP technical standard — provided the construction sector deems it a suitable standard for its DPP requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Article 76</strong> — Defines the minimum content that a DPP must contain: the declaration of performance and conformity (DoPC), safety information, relevant technical documentation, labels, and unique product identifiers.</li>
  <li><strong>Articles 77–78</strong> — Set out interoperability requirements, access rights, data security, and protections for trade secrets and confidential business information.</li>
  <li><strong>Articles 79–80</strong> — Provide for alignment with the ESPR's DPP infrastructure (unique identifiers, the DPP registry, and the web portal) and establish the operational timeline.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a notable design choice: the CPR builds on, and is designed to be interoperable with, the ESPR's horizontal DPP architecture — but it does so through a sector-specific regulation that reflects the particularities of construction products.</p>

<h2>When Do DPP Obligations Actually Apply?</h2>

<p>This is the central question for the industry — and the answer is more nuanced than a single date. DPP obligations for any product family depend on <strong>two conditions being met simultaneously</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The product family must be covered by a <strong>new harmonised technical specification</strong> (HTS) under CPR 2024/3110 — replacing its current standard under CPR 305/2011.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Article 75 delegated act</strong> — which sets out the technical design of the DPP for construction products — must be <strong>in force</strong>. After entry into force, there is a 6-month period for the technical infrastructure to become operational, followed by a further 18 months before obligations begin to apply to economic operators. This delegated act builds on the ESPR's horizontal DPP infrastructure (the EU registry, unique identifier scheme, and web portal), which must itself be in place first.</li>
</ol>

<figure>
  <img src="Blogs/cpr-digital-product-passport/timeline-dpp-obligations.svg" alt="Timeline showing DPP obligation staging under Article 75: delegated act adoption (TBD), entry into force, technical infrastructure ready at EIF + 6 months, obligations apply at EIF + 18 months — only for products under CPR 2024/3110 harmonised specs">
</figure>

<p>Until both conditions are satisfied, DPP use remains voluntary for that product family. The practical start date is always the <strong>later of the two</strong>: even if a product family's new harmonised standard is cited in the Official Journal, DPP obligations won't apply until the Article 75 delegated act has been in force long enough for the 18-month lead-in to elapse — and vice versa.</p>

</div>

<h2>The Path from Preparatory Work to DPP</h2>

<p>This is the process that will determine the real-world timeline for construction product DPPs. The CPR's <strong>Annex VII</strong> defines product families — broad groupings such as precast concrete, doors and windows, thermal insulation, and structural metallic products. Harmonised standards under the old CPR 305/2011 remain valid until they are formally <strong>withdrawn and replaced</strong> by new harmonised technical specifications (HTS) under CPR 2024/3110. Products migrate to the new regulatory regime <strong>family by family</strong>, as new standards are developed, adopted, and referenced in the Official Journal — and a DPP becomes mandatory for a given product only once its family has completed this transition <strong>and</strong> the Article 75 delegated act is in force.</p>

<p>The Commission's <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2025:772:FIN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working Plan (COM(2025) 772)</a> tracks six milestones per product family, typically spanning <strong>4.5–5.5 years</strong> from start to finish:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="Blogs/cpr-digital-product-passport/timeline-hts-adoption.svg" alt="Timeline of the harmonised technical specification adoption process under CPR 2024/3110: Milestone I product scope (~6 months), Milestone III essential characteristics (~6 months), standardisation request adopted, standard development by TC (36 months), standard mandatory plus delegated act (~6 months), coexistence period (12–24 months), new HTS in force — total approximately 4.5–5.5 years" loading="lazy">
  <figcaption class="sr-only">
    <p>The adoption of a new harmonised technical specification under Regulation (EU) 2024/3110 follows six stages, as defined in the Commission's Working Plan (COM(2025) 772, Table 3):</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Milestone I — Product scope definition</strong> (~6 months) — The Commission defines the product scope for the family: which products fall within the family, what the regulatory boundaries are, and what existing standards need revision or replacement.</li>
      <li><strong>Milestone III — Essential characteristics</strong> (~6 months) — The essential characteristics to be declared for products in the family are defined, along with the assessment methods and performance thresholds required under the new regulation.</li>
      <li><strong>Standardisation request adopted</strong> — The Commission sends a formal request to CEN/CENELEC, specifying the scope, essential characteristics, and assessment methods required. The standardisation request sets a delivery deadline, typically 36 months.</li>
      <li><strong>Standard development</strong> (36 months typical) — The responsible Technical Committee (TC) develops the harmonised technical specification through successive stages: working drafts, committee draft, public enquiry, formal vote, and publication.</li>
      <li><strong>Standard mandatory + delegated act</strong> (~6 months) — The Commission assesses the delivered standard, and if satisfactory, adopts a delegated act making the standard mandatory and citing it in the Official Journal.</li>
      <li><strong>Coexistence period</strong> (12–24 months) — The old and new standards coexist during a transition period, after which the old standard is withdrawn and only the new HTS applies.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Total typical duration from preparatory work to enforceable harmonised standard: approximately 4.5–5.5 years. Products remain under old CPR 305/2011 standards until the new HTS is in force for their product family.</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Commission's Table 3 reveals a continuous spectrum of progress across all 37 families. A critical legal nuance: <strong>DPP obligations under Chapter X are linked to the Declaration of Performance and Conformity (DoPC)</strong>, which only applies to products covered by new harmonised technical specifications under CPR 2024/3110. Products still CE-marked under old harmonised standards cited under CPR 305/2011 — such as precast concrete (PCR, currently under EN 13369 etc.) and structural metallic products (SMP, currently under EN 1090-1) — continue using the old Declaration of Performance (DoP) and are <strong>not yet subject to DPP obligations</strong>. DPP for these families will only apply once new HTS under CPR 2024/3110 replaces their current standards, which is realistically expected around <strong>~2030–2031</strong>. For families with genuine new standard development (cement, doors and windows, thermal insulation), DPP obligations are expected around <strong>2029–2030</strong>. Later families without acquis work extend to <strong>2032–2034</strong>. Crucially, the Article 75 delegated act — which has not yet been adopted — is expected to enter into force and complete its 18-month lead-in by approximately 2028–2029, well before most product families' new HTS is ready. This means <strong>the harmonised standard is the binding constraint</strong> for the vast majority of families: once a product family's new HTS is in force, the DPP infrastructure and obligations will already be in place.</p>

<h2 id="cpr-product-grid">The Commission's Working Plan (2026–2029)</h2>

<p>In late 2025, the Commission published its <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2025:772:FIN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working Plan (COM(2025) 772)</a> for the rollout of harmonised technical specifications under the recast CPR. Its Table 3 provides granular milestone dates for all 37 product families — from product scope definition through to the delegated act making each standard mandatory.</p>

<p>The 37 product families below are ordered by their estimated DPP obligation date — earliest first — based on the readiness of existing standards and the work of <a href="https://www.cencenelec.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEN/CENELEC</a> technical committees. The DPP obligation estimates are derived from Table 3 milestone dates plus the coexistence period and the Article 75 delegated act timeline. The numbers (e.g. #1, #20) refer to the product family numbers assigned in the CPR's Annex VII — they are regulatory reference numbers, not a priority ranking:</p>

    <p>Under Article 76 of Regulation (EU) 2024/3110 (Construction Products Regulation), a Digital Product Passport must contain at minimum:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Declaration of Performance and Conformity (DoPC)</strong> — the central document certifying that a product meets the applicable harmonised technical specifications.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety Information</strong> — relevant to the product's intended use.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical Documentation</strong> — including test reports and assessment results.</li>
      <li><strong>Labels and Markings</strong> — product labels and CE markings.</li>
      <li><strong>Unique Product Identifier</strong> — enabling traceability across the supply chain.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Access must be provided free of charge via a data carrier (e.g. QR code) on the product or packaging, with differentiated access levels per stakeholder.</p>

<h2>Interoperability and Open Standards</h2>

<p>Articles 77 and 78 contain unusually explicit requirements for the DPP's technical architecture. The regulation mandates:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Open standards</strong> — data must be structured in open, machine-readable formats.</li>
  <li><strong>No vendor lock-in</strong> — the DPP system must not tie manufacturers or other economic operators to proprietary platforms.</li>
  <li><strong>Interoperability</strong> — the system must work across different software environments and be compatible with existing digital tools used in the construction sector, including <strong>Building Information Modelling (BIM)</strong> systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Data security and trade secrets</strong> — access controls must protect confidential business information while ensuring that regulators and market surveillance authorities can access the data they need.</li>
</ul>

<p>The emphasis on BIM compatibility is distinctive to the CPR and reflects the construction sector's existing digital infrastructure. It signals that the Commission sees the DPP not as a standalone compliance tool, but as a layer that integrates with how the industry already manages product data.</p>

<h2>What Should the Industry Do Now?</h2>

<p>Despite the uncertainty around exact dates, the direction is clear. Manufacturers and other economic operators in the construction sector should:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Map your products to the working plan.</strong> Identify which Annex VII product families your products fall under and check where those families sit in the Commission's rollout timeline.</li>
  <li><strong>Start collecting and structuring product data.</strong> The DPP will require declarations of performance, safety information, technical documentation, and unique identifiers. Much of this data already exists but is often fragmented across different systems and formats.</li>
  <li><strong>Engage with CEN/CENELEC.</strong> If your product family's standardisation request has been adopted or is in preparation, the standards development process is already underway. Industry input — particularly from SMEs — is critical to ensuring the resulting specifications are both ambitious and workable.</li>
  <li><strong>Build DPP-ready data infrastructure.</strong> The regulation's emphasis on open standards, machine-readable formats, and BIM compatibility means that proprietary, siloed product data systems will not meet the requirements. Start investing in interoperable digital product data now.</li>
</ul>

<p>The CPR recast represents a generational shift in how construction products are documented, tracked, and verified across the EU market. The DPP is not an add-on — it is a core part of the new regulatory architecture. Getting ahead of it is not just good compliance; it is a competitive advantage.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024R3110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Construction Products Regulation (EU) 2024/3110</a> — the recast of the original CPR 305/2011 — is one of the most significant pieces of EU internal market legislation for the construction sector in over a decade. Among its many innovations, it introduces a full Digital Product Passport (DPP) framework for construction products, set out in Chapter X (Articles 75–80). In this article, we walk through the legislative timeline, the DPP provisions, the critical role of harmonised standards, and what the Commission's Working Plan tells us about when different product families will actually be affected.</p>

<h2>Legislative Timeline</h2>

<p>The path from proposal to applicable regulation took nearly four years:</p>

<h2>Where the DPP Lives in the CPR — Chapter X</h2>

<p>The DPP provisions are concentrated in Chapter X of the regulation, spanning Articles 75 to 80. Unlike the ESPR, which delegates DPP details almost entirely to product-specific delegated acts, the CPR recast builds a substantial DPP framework directly into the regulation text:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Article 75</strong> — Establishes the DPP system. The Commission is empowered to adopt a <strong>delegated act</strong> setting out the technical design of the DPP system for construction products. In practice, it is expected that this delegated act will likely be adopted after the <a href="https://www.cencenelec.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEN/CENELEC</a> JTC24 working groups have published the DPP technical standard — provided the construction sector deems it a suitable standard for its DPP requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Article 76</strong> — Defines the minimum content that a DPP must contain: the declaration of performance and conformity (DoPC), safety information, relevant technical documentation, labels, and unique product identifiers.</li>
  <li><strong>Articles 77–78</strong> — Set out interoperability requirements, access rights, data security, and protections for trade secrets and confidential business information.</li>
  <li><strong>Articles 79–80</strong> — Provide for alignment with the ESPR's DPP infrastructure (unique identifiers, the DPP registry, and the web portal) and establish the operational timeline.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a notable design choice: the CPR builds on, and is designed to be interoperable with, the ESPR's horizontal DPP architecture — but it does so through a sector-specific regulation that reflects the particularities of construction products.</p>

<h2>What the DPP Must Contain</h2>

<p>Article 76 specifies the minimum information that must be accessible through a construction product's DPP:</p>

  <img src="Blogs/cpr-digital-product-passport/dpp-minimum-content.svg" alt="Five categories of minimum DPP content under Article 76: Declaration of Performance and Conformity, Safety Information, Technical Documentation, Labels and Markings, and Unique Product Identifier — accessible free of charge via data carrier">
</figure>

<h2>Interoperability and Open Standards</h2>

<p>Articles 77 and 78 contain unusually explicit requirements for the DPP's technical architecture. The regulation mandates:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Open standards</strong> — data must be structured in open, machine-readable formats.</li>
  <li><strong>No vendor lock-in</strong> — the DPP system must not tie manufacturers or other economic operators to proprietary platforms.</li>
  <li><strong>Interoperability</strong> — the system must work across different software environments and be compatible with existing digital tools used in the construction sector, including <strong>Building Information Modelling (BIM)</strong> systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Data security and trade secrets</strong> — access controls must protect confidential business information while ensuring that regulators and market surveillance authorities can access the data they need.</li>
</ul>

<p>The emphasis on BIM compatibility is distinctive to the CPR and reflects the construction sector's existing digital infrastructure. It signals that the Commission sees the DPP not as a standalone compliance tool, but as a layer that integrates with how the industry already manages product data.</p>

<h2>When Do DPP Obligations Actually Apply?</h2>

<p>This is the central question for the industry — and the answer is more nuanced than a single date:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="Blogs/cpr-digital-product-passport/timeline-dpp-obligations.svg" alt="Timeline showing DPP obligation staging: delegated act adoption (TBD), entry into force, system operational at EIF + 6 months, obligations apply at EIF + 18 months — only for products under CPR 2024/3110 harmonised specs">
</figure>

<h2>The Harmonised Standards Gateway</h2>

<p>This is the mechanism that will determine the real-world timeline for construction product DPPs. Understanding it is essential:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The CPR's <strong>Annex VII</strong> defines product families — broad groupings such as precast concrete, doors and windows, thermal insulation, structural metallic products, and so on.</li>
  <li>Harmonised standards under the old CPR 305/2011 remain valid until they are formally <strong>withdrawn and replaced</strong> by new harmonised technical specifications under CPR 2024/3110.</li>
  <li>Products migrate to the new regulatory regime <strong>family by family</strong>, as the new standards are developed, adopted, and referenced in the Official Journal.</li>
  <li>A DPP becomes mandatory for a given product only once it falls within the CPR 2024/3110 "harmonised zone" <strong>and</strong> the DPP system delegated act is operational.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, even if the DPP system delegated act were adopted tomorrow, DPP obligations would only apply to those product families for which new harmonised technical specifications are already in place. The rest of the market continues under the old regime until its standards are replaced.</p>

<h2>The Commission's Working Plan (2026–2029)</h2>

<p>In early 2025, the Commission published its <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2025:772:FIN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working Plan (COM(2025) 772)</a> for the rollout of harmonised technical specifications under the recast CPR. This document provides the most concrete indication yet of when different product families will transition to the new regime — and therefore when they may become subject to DPP requirements.</p>

<p>The rollout is organised in waves, based on the readiness of existing standards and the work of <a href="https://www.cencenelec.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEN/CENELEC</a> technical committees:</p>

<h3>Front-runners (standardisation requests 2025, standards expected 2025–2027)</h3>

  <li><strong>#11</strong> Sanitary appliances</li>
  <li><strong>#28</strong> Pipes, tanks, and ancillaries not in contact with water for human consumption</li>
  <li><strong>#31</strong> Cables, wires, and accessories</li>
  <li>Decorative paints (new product family)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Which Families Will Require a DPP First?</h2>

<p>Based on the working plan, the front-runner families — precast concrete, structural metallic products, cement, and doors/windows — are the most likely candidates for the first DPP obligations. These have the most mature standards conversion process and could realistically have new harmonised technical specifications in place by 2027.</p>

<p>However, the actual DPP obligation depends on <strong>two conditions being met simultaneously</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The product family must be covered by a harmonised technical specification under CPR 2024/3110.</li>
  <li>The DPP system delegated act must be operational (i.e. adopted + 6 months for the system, + 18 months for obligations).</li>
</ol>

<p>Until both conditions are satisfied, DPP use remains voluntary. This means the practical timeline is the <strong>later of the two</strong>: even if a product family's standards are ready in 2027, DPP obligations won't apply until the delegated act has been operational for 18 months.</p>

<h2>What Should the Industry Do Now?</h2>

<p>Despite the uncertainty around exact dates, the direction is clear. Manufacturers and other economic operators in the construction sector should:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Map your products to the working plan.</strong> Identify which Annex VII product families your products fall under and check where those families sit in the Commission's rollout timeline.</li>
  <li><strong>Start collecting and structuring product data.</strong> The DPP will require declarations of performance, safety information, technical documentation, and unique identifiers. Much of this data already exists but is often fragmented across different systems and formats.</li>
  <li><strong>Engage with CEN/CENELEC.</strong> If your product family is in the front-runner or active conversion wave, the standards development process is already underway. Industry input — particularly from SMEs — is critical to ensuring the resulting specifications are both ambitious and workable.</li>
  <li><strong>Build DPP-ready data infrastructure.</strong> The regulation's emphasis on open standards, machine-readable formats, and BIM compatibility means that proprietary, siloed product data systems will not meet the requirements. Start investing in interoperable digital product data now.</li>
</ul>

<p>The CPR recast represents a generational shift in how construction products are documented, tracked, and verified across the EU market. The DPP is not an add-on — it is a core part of the new regulatory architecture. Getting ahead of it is not just good compliance; it is a competitive advantage.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024R3110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Construction Products Regulation (EU) 2024/3110</a> — the recast of the original CPR 305/2011 — is one of the most significant pieces of EU internal market legislation for the construction sector in over a decade. Among its many innovations, it introduces a full Digital Product Passport (DPP) framework for construction products, set out in Chapter X (Articles 75–80). In this article, we walk through the legislative timeline, the DPP provisions, the critical role of harmonised standards, and what the Commission's Working Plan tells us about when different product families will actually be affected.</p>

<h2>Legislative Timeline</h2>

<p>The path from proposal to applicable regulation took nearly four years:</p>

</figure>

<h2>Where the DPP Lives in the CPR — Chapter X</h2>

<p>The DPP provisions are concentrated in Chapter X of the regulation, spanning Articles 75 to 80. Unlike the ESPR, which delegates DPP details almost entirely to product-specific delegated acts, the CPR recast builds a substantial DPP framework directly into the regulation text:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Article 75</strong> — Establishes the DPP system. The Commission is empowered to adopt a <strong>delegated act</strong> setting out the technical design of the DPP system for construction products. In practice, it is expected that this delegated act will likely be adopted after the <a href="https://www.cencenelec.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEN/CENELEC</a> JTC24 working groups have published the DPP technical standard — provided the construction sector deems it a suitable standard for its DPP requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Article 76</strong> — Defines the minimum content that a DPP must contain: the declaration of performance and conformity (DoPC), safety information, relevant technical documentation, labels, and unique product identifiers.</li>
  <li><strong>Articles 77–78</strong> — Set out interoperability requirements, access rights, data security, and protections for trade secrets and confidential business information.</li>
  <li><strong>Article 79</strong> — Establishes the <strong>DPP registry</strong>: manufacturers must upload unique product identifiers and related data to this EU-level digital registry (shared with ESPR), expected operational in 2026. <strong>Article 80</strong> — Provides for a publicly accessible <strong>web portal</strong> for searching and comparing DPP data, and sets out the operational timeline.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a notable design choice: the CPR builds on, and is designed to be interoperable with, the ESPR's horizontal DPP architecture — but it does so through a sector-specific regulation that reflects the particularities of construction products.</p>

<h2>When Do DPP Obligations Actually Apply?</h2>

<p>This is the central question for the industry — and the answer is more nuanced than a single date. DPP obligations for any product family depend on <strong>two conditions being met simultaneously</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The product family must be covered by a <strong>new harmonised technical specification</strong> (HTS) under CPR 2024/3110 — replacing its current standard under CPR 305/2011.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Article 75 delegated act</strong> — which sets out the technical design of the DPP for construction products — must be <strong>in force</strong>. Per Article 75(8), DPP obligations apply <strong>18 months after entry into force</strong> of this delegated act. Within that 18-month window, the technical infrastructure (built on the ESPR's horizontal DPP architecture — the EU registry, unique identifier scheme, and web portal) must become operational.</li>
</ol>

<figure>
  <img src="Blogs/cpr-digital-product-passport/timeline-dpp-obligations.svg" alt="Timeline showing DPP obligation staging under Article 75: delegated act adoption (TBD), entry into force, technical infrastructure ready at EIF + 6 months, obligations apply at EIF + 18 months — only for products under CPR 2024/3110 harmonised specs">
</figure>

<p>Until both conditions are satisfied, DPP use remains voluntary for that product family. The practical start date is always the <strong>later of the two</strong>: even if a product family's new harmonised standard is cited in the Official Journal, DPP obligations won't apply until the Article 75 delegated act has been in force long enough for the 18-month lead-in to elapse — and vice versa.</p>

</div>

<h2>The Path from Preparatory Work to DPP</h2>

<p>This is the process that will determine the real-world timeline for construction product DPPs. The CPR's <strong>Annex VII</strong> defines product families — broad groupings such as precast concrete, doors and windows, thermal insulation, and structural metallic products. Harmonised standards under the old CPR 305/2011 remain valid until they are formally <strong>withdrawn and replaced</strong> by new harmonised technical specifications (HTS) under CPR 2024/3110. Products migrate to the new regulatory regime <strong>family by family</strong>, as new standards are developed, adopted, and referenced in the Official Journal — and a DPP becomes mandatory for a given product only once its family has completed this transition <strong>and</strong> the Article 75 delegated act is in force.</p>

<p>The Commission's <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2025:772:FIN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working Plan (COM(2025) 772)</a> tracks six milestones per product family, typically spanning <strong>4.5–5.5 years</strong> from start to finish:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="Blogs/cpr-digital-product-passport/timeline-hts-adoption.svg" alt="Timeline of the harmonised technical specification adoption process under CPR 2024/3110: Milestone I product scope (~6 months), Milestone III essential characteristics (~6 months), standardisation request adopted, standard development by TC (36 months), standard mandatory plus delegated act (~6 months), coexistence period (12–24 months), new HTS in force — total approximately 4.5–5.5 years" loading="lazy">
  <figcaption class="sr-only">
    <p>The adoption of a new harmonised technical specification under Regulation (EU) 2024/3110 follows six stages, as defined in the Commission's Working Plan (COM(2025) 772, Table 3):</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Milestone I — Product scope definition</strong> (~6 months) — The Commission defines the product scope for the family: which products fall within the family, what the regulatory boundaries are, and what existing standards need revision or replacement.</li>
      <li><strong>Milestone III — Essential characteristics</strong> (~6 months) — The essential characteristics to be declared for products in the family are defined, along with the assessment methods and performance thresholds required under the new regulation.</li>
      <li><strong>Standardisation request adopted</strong> — The Commission sends a formal request to CEN/CENELEC, specifying the scope, essential characteristics, and assessment methods required. The standardisation request sets a delivery deadline, typically 36 months.</li>
      <li><strong>Standard development</strong> (36 months typical) — The responsible Technical Committee (TC) develops the harmonised technical specification through successive stages: working drafts, committee draft, public enquiry, formal vote, and publication.</li>
      <li><strong>Standard mandatory + delegated act</strong> (~6 months) — The Commission assesses the delivered standard, and if satisfactory, adopts a delegated act making the standard mandatory and citing it in the Official Journal.</li>
      <li><strong>Coexistence period</strong> (12–24 months) — The old and new standards coexist during a transition period, after which the old standard is withdrawn and only the new HTS applies.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Total typical duration from preparatory work to enforceable harmonised standard: approximately 4.5–5.5 years. Products remain under old CPR 305/2011 standards until the new HTS is in force for their product family.</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Commission's Table 3 reveals a continuous spectrum of progress across all 37 families. A critical legal nuance: <strong>DPP obligations under Chapter X are linked to the Declaration of Performance and Conformity (DoPC)</strong>, which only applies to products covered by new harmonised technical specifications under CPR 2024/3110. Products still CE-marked under old harmonised standards cited under CPR 305/2011 — such as precast concrete (PCR, currently under EN 13369 etc.) and structural metallic products (SMP, currently under EN 1090-1) — continue using the old Declaration of Performance (DoP) and are <strong>not yet subject to DPP obligations</strong>. DPP for these families will only apply once new HTS under CPR 2024/3110 replaces their current standards. Based on the Working Plan milestones and typical standardisation timelines, our <strong>scenario estimate</strong> is <strong>~2030–2031</strong> for these earliest families — but this depends on standardisation requests being adopted on schedule and on CEN/CENELEC meeting delivery deadlines. For families with genuine new standard development under the new CPR (cement, doors and windows, thermal insulation), the scenario estimate is <strong>~2029–2030</strong>. Later families without acquis work extend to <strong>~2032–2034</strong>. These year-specific estimates are scenario assumptions, not regulatory commitments. Two conditions must converge: (1) the product family's new HTS must be in force, and (2) the Article 75 delegated act must have been adopted and the 18-month lead-in must have elapsed. The delegated act has not yet been adopted; based on the legislative programme, we <strong>estimate</strong> it will complete its lead-in by approximately 2028–2029, well before most product families' new HTS is ready. If that assumption holds, <strong>the harmonised standard is the binding constraint</strong> for the vast majority of families.</p>

<h2>Two Routes to CE Marking — and Two Paths to DPP</h2>

<p>A common misconception is that DPP obligations will activate for an entire product family at once. In practice, the rollout will be uneven within a product family because standardisation requests set deadlines at the level of <strong>individual deliverables and standards</strong>, not a single family-wide switch date. To understand why, it helps to know the two routes through which construction products reach CE marking today:</p>

<h3>Route 1: Harmonised standards (hENs)</h3>

<p>The majority of construction products are covered by <strong>harmonised European standards</strong> (hENs) — product specifications developed by CEN Technical Committees under a Commission mandate and cited in the Official Journal. Products covered by an hEN <em>must</em> be CE marked. Under the new CPR 2024/3110, each existing hEN will eventually be replaced by a new <strong>Harmonised Technical Specification (HTS)</strong>. DPP obligations apply to a product once its specific HTS is in force — but different hENs within the same product family will be revised and adopted at different times. For example, in the Roof Coverings family (ROC), EN 490 (concrete tiles) could receive its new HTS before EN 1304 (clay tiles), meaning DPP for concrete roof tiles would activate before clay roof tiles — even though both belong to the same family.</p>

<h3>Route 2: European Assessment Documents (EADs) and European Technical Assessments (ETAs)</h3>

<p>When no harmonised standard exists for a product — typically innovative, niche, or novel products — manufacturers can obtain a <strong>European Technical Assessment (ETA)</strong> via an <strong>European Assessment Document (EAD)</strong> developed by <a href="https://www.eota.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EOTA</a>. This is the CE marking route for products like green roof kits, FRP reinforcement bars, structural building kits, and many other innovations. Some product families rely <em>entirely</em> on EADs — Building Kits (KAS) has an estimated ~32 EADs and zero harmonised standards. Others use both routes: Roof Coverings (ROC) has approximately 21 hENs alongside ~32 EADs, and Products related to Concrete (CMG) has approximately 16 hENs plus ~19 EADs covering circular economy innovations like steel fibres recovered from end-of-life tyres and municipal waste incinerator bottom ash. (Note: per-family hEN and EAD counts are approximate, based on the <a href="https://www.nlfnorm.cz/en/ehn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nlfnorm.cz harmonised standards database</a> and <a href="https://www.eota.eu/eads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EOTA's EAD database</a>, mapped to CPR Annex VII product families. Exact counts may vary as the Commission's official lists are updated.)</p>

<p>Under CPR 2024/3110, the EAD/ETA route has its own transition timeline:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Old EADs</strong> (adopted under CPR 305/2011) remain valid for issuing ETAs <strong>until 9 January 2031</strong> (five years from the Regulation's entry into force, per Article 95).</li>
  <li><strong>ETAs issued under old EADs</strong> remain valid for CE marking <strong>until 9 January 2036</strong> (ten years from entry into force).</li>
  <li><strong>New EADs</strong> under CPR 2024/3110 must include <strong>environmental sustainability requirements</strong> (per Article 42): GWP declaration immediately upon adoption, core life cycle assessment indicators by 2029, and full LCA by 2031. (Note: the separate manufacturer <em>declaration</em> obligations under Article 15 follow a slightly later schedule — GWP from 8 January 2026, core indicators from 9 January 2030, all indicators from 9 January 2032.)</li>
  <li>New EADs have a <strong>10-year validity period</strong>. ETAs issued under new EADs have <strong>no expiry</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>DPP obligations for EAD/ETA products follow a similar logic: products placed on the market under <strong>new ETAs</strong> (issued against EADs adopted under CPR 2024/3110) will use the Declaration of Performance and Conformity (DoPC) and therefore fall under Chapter X DPP obligations. Products still operating under <strong>old ETAs</strong> (valid until 9 January 2036) are not subject to DPP — analogous to how products under old hENs use the old DoP and remain outside the DPP system.</p>

<h3>The innovator's paradox</h3>

<p>This two-route structure creates a counterintuitive outcome that the industry has not yet widely recognised: <strong>innovative products using the EAD/ETA route could face DPP obligations <em>before</em> mainstream products in the same family</strong> that are covered by harmonised standards — provided the Article 75 delegated act is in force and the manufacturer is using a new ETA issued under a CPR 2024/3110 EAD. Here is why.</p>

<p>In the new CPR architecture, the DoPC is a core element of what the DPP must contain, and the <strong>Declaration of Performance and Conformity (DoPC)</strong> is the key mechanism linking both routes to DPP obligations. Any product that issues a DoPC under CPR 2024/3110 falls within the scope of Chapter X. Both routes lead to a DoPC: a product covered by a new HTS issues one, and a product with a new ETA (against a CPR 2024/3110 EAD) issues one. Limited exemptions exist under Article 14 (e.g., individually manufactured products), but for mass-market construction products the DoPC — and therefore DPP — is the standard path.</p>

<p>The paradox arises from timing. EOTA can adopt a new EAD in roughly <strong>12–18 months</strong> — the process involves a single Technical Assessment Body drafting the document and EOTA's technical board validating it. By contrast, developing a new HTS through CEN/CENELEC typically takes <strong>36 months</strong> of TC work alone, preceded by 12+ months of preparatory milestones and followed by a coexistence period. This means a manufacturer of, say, an innovative green roof kit could obtain a new ETA under a CPR 2024/3110 EAD and be required to issue a DoPC — triggering DPP obligations — years before the mainstream clay or concrete roof tiles in the same family (ROC) have their harmonised standard replaced.</p>

<p>This is not a theoretical edge case. It affects every product family that has both hENs and EADs — which is the majority of the 37 families. Whether a product reaches CE marking through the hEN route or the EAD route, the transition timing to a DoPC — and therefore to DPP obligations — differs by route. The practical effect is that there is no way to indefinitely defer DPP: once a manufacturer's product falls under a new HTS or a new ETA under CPR 2024/3110, the DoPC requirement and the associated DPP obligation follow, subject to the Article 75 delegated act being in force and the 18-month lead-in having elapsed.</p>

<h3>What the family-level estimates really mean</h3>

<p>The DPP date estimates shown on each product family card below represent the <strong>envelope</strong> — the approximate date by which the last major products within that family are expected to be subject to DPP. In practice, individual products within a family will transition at different times depending on when their specific hEN is replaced by a new HTS, or when their EAD is adopted under the new CPR. Early products within a "~2032–2033" family could realistically see DPP obligations by 2030–2031 if their particular standard is prioritised in the standardisation request.</p>

<h2 id="cpr-product-grid">The Commission's Working Plan (2026–2029)</h2>

<p>In late 2025, the Commission published its <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2025:772:FIN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working Plan (COM(2025) 772)</a> for the rollout of harmonised technical specifications under the recast CPR. Its Table 3 provides granular milestone dates for all 37 product families — from product scope definition through to the delegated act making each standard mandatory.</p>

<p>The 37 product families below are ordered by their estimated DPP obligation date — earliest first — based on the readiness of existing standards and the work of <a href="https://www.cencenelec.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEN/CENELEC</a> technical committees. The DPP obligation estimates are derived from Table 3 milestone dates plus the coexistence period and the Article 75 delegated act timeline. The numbers (e.g. #1, #20) refer to the product family numbers assigned in the CPR's Annex VII — they are regulatory reference numbers, not a priority ranking:</p>

Feedback until <strong>3 Mar 2026</strong>. Under <strong>CPR 305/2011</strong> (old regulation). Replaces mandate M/100 (1994). <strong>4 deliverables</strong>, all due <strong>30 Oct 2026</strong>: (1) new hEN for precast concrete performance assessment (Table 1), (2) EPD product category rules for lightweight and AAC products (Table 1), (3) revision of EN 1520:2011 (Table 2), (4) revision of EN 12602:2016 (Table 2). Decision expires 30 Jun 2027. CEN reports due 31 Jan 2027. Table 3 target of SReq Q2 2025 was <strong>missed by ~8 months</strong>. <strong>NOT yet adopted</strong> — CEN WP 2025 still lists as &quot;M/XXX&quot; (no mandate number assigned).</p><p><strong>DPP outlook:</strong> The current standardisation request is issued under the old CPR 305/2011, so products under these standards are not yet subject to DPP obligations. A separate standardisation request under the new CPR 2024/3110 will be needed to create harmonised technical specifications that trigger DPP. Based on the expected timeline for that second request and the subsequent mandatory adoption and coexistence period, DPP is estimated around <strong>~2030–2031</strong>.</p>">

    data-info="<p><strong>About this family:</strong> Covers structural steel and aluminium products used in load-bearing construction, including hot-rolled and cold-formed sections, stainless steel structural members, high-strength and non-preloaded bolting assemblies, welding consumables, and insulating sandwich panels. Conformity assessment centres on the execution of steel and aluminium structures and their components. Standardisation is led by CEN/TC 135.</p><p><strong>Current harmonised standards:</strong> EN 1090-1:2009+A1:2011 is the primary conformity assessment standard, but the OJ-cited harmonised standards for this family also include EN 15088:2005, EN 10340:2007, EN 14399-1:2015, EN 15048-1:2007, EN 13479:2017, EN 10025-1:2004, EN 10210-1:2006, EN 10219-1:2006, EN 10088-4:2009, and EN 10088-5:2009 (all under mandate M/120 and CPR 305/2011).

Concerns raised: unclear scope, undefined terminology, unnecessary/missing performance characteristics (welding suitability, fracture toughness, fatigue strength removed).

    data-info="<p><strong>About this family:</strong> Covers the full range of cements, building limes, and hydraulic binders used in construction, from common Portland cements and masonry cements to specialist types such as calcium aluminate, supersulphated, and very low heat cements, as well as hydraulic road binders. Cement is explicitly carved out of the ESPR, meaning sustainability requirements are set under the CPR instead. Standardisation is led by CEN/TC 51.</p><p><strong>Current harmonised standards:</strong> EN 197-1:2011 (common cement), EN 14216:2015, EN 413-1:2011, EN 14647:2005, EN 15743:2010+A1:2015, EN 459-1:2010, EN 13282-1:2013, EN 15368:2008+A1:2010. All cited under old CPR 305/2011 via mandate M/114 (1997). GWP declarations mandatory from 8 Jan 2026 (Annex II). CBAM financial obligations from 1 Jan 2026.</p><p><strong>Standards in development:</strong> prEN 197-1 rev — new project approved 2 July 2025 by CEN/TC 51 (stage 10.99). Revision will integrate EN 197-5 (CEM II/C-M and CEM VI low-carbon cements) and EN 197-6 (cement with recycled building materials), enabling wider range of low-carbon cements. EN 196-12:2024 published Dec 2024 (reactivity test methods supporting performance-based approach). <strong style=&quot;color:#E71846;&quot;>NOTE: Only EN 197-1 has a registered CEN prEN project.</strong> All other 8 standards covered by C(2025) 4828 have no registered prEN yet — risk for 2027-2028 deadlines.</p><p><strong>Standardisation request:</strong> Acquis Milestone I (product scope) and Milestone III (essential characteristics) both completed. <a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/documents-register/api/files/C(2025)4828_0/de00000001073540?rendition=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>Commission Implementing Decision C(2025) 4828</a>, adopted <strong>28 July 2025</strong>. Confirmed under <strong>CPR 2024/3110</strong> (title: &quot;in support of Regulation (EU) 2024/3110&quot;). DPP applies directly.

Decision expires 30 Jun 2030.</p><p><strong>EAD route:</strong> EAD 150080-00-0301 (blended cements with reduced clinker content) <strong>formally cited in OJEU December 2025</strong> — milestone for low-carbon cement technologies. Ecocem holds ETA 23-0877 (ACT technology, issued by Cerema Dec 2023) and is building a EUR 50M production facility in Dunkirk (300kt/yr capacity, commercial operation H2 2026). Commission signalled Feb 2025 that an EOTA mandate for alkali-activated cements EAD could follow by 2027.</p><p><strong>Alkali-activated cements:</strong> Downgraded to Technical Report in C(2025) 4828, despite <a href=&quot;https://ecostandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Joint-letter-draft-standardisation-requests-for-cement-13-May-2025.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>strong stakeholder opposition</a> (19 signatories). CEN/TC 51 refused to develop standards. A performance-based standard for alternative low-carbon cements requested for delivery by 2030.</p><p><strong>DPP outlook:</strong> The standardisation request is confirmed under CPR 2024/3110, so the resulting standards will directly trigger DPP obligations. The lead standard for common cements is due <strong>June 2027</strong>, with mandatory adoption expected by <strong>late 2028</strong> and the harmonised technical specification in force around 2029 to 2030. DPP is estimated around <strong>~2029–2030</strong>, making this one of the earliest families likely to require a digital product passport.</p>">

Materials span metal, clay/ceramic, concrete and plastic. Free-standing industrial chimneys are excluded and follow a separate standardisation track. Standardisation is led by CEN/TC 166 (hENs) and EOTA (EADs).</p><p><strong>Current harmonised standards:</strong> 18 harmonised product standards are cited in the OJ under mandate M/105 (CPR 305/2011), with AVCP System 2+ as the primary system for general characteristics (reaction to fire assessed separately under System 1 or 3 per Commission Decision 95/467/EC as amended by 2010/679/EU). Key standards include: EN 1856-1:2009 and EN 1856-2:2009 (metal chimneys), EN 1857:2010 and EN 1858:2008+A1:2011 (concrete components), EN 1457-1:2012 and EN 1457-2:2012 (clay/ceramic flue liners), EN 13063-1/2/3 (clay/ceramic system chimneys), EN 14471:2013+A1:2015 (plastic flue liners), and EN 14989-1/2:2007 (room-sealed applications). EN 1443:2019 serves as the general requirements reference standard.</p><p><strong>European Assessment Documents:</strong> 11 chimney-specific EADs exist under Product Area 06, of which 10 are cited in the OJ (7 via Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/450 as amended, 3 via earlier C-series OJ communications). All under AVCP System 1. EAD 060017 is pending OJ citation. These are old-regime EADs under CPR 305/2011 — they can be used for issuing ETAs until <strong>9 January 2031</strong>, and existing ETAs remain valid for CE marking until <strong>9 January 2036</strong>. DPP does not apply to products covered by these old-regime EADs.</p><p><strong>Standards in development:</strong> CEN/TC 166 is proactively revising several standards under its own work programme. <strong>These revisions are TC-driven under the existing mandate M/105 (CPR 305/2011) — they are not yet mandated under CPR 2024/3110 and do not trigger DPP obligations on their own.</strong> However, the revision work is expected to be incorporated into the forthcoming standardisation request under CPR 2024/3110.<br>• prEN 1856-1 rev — metal system chimney products (revision status uncertain — genorma shows CEN project deleted Mar 2021, but DIN/BSI references suggest a draft was circulated and may have restarted)<br>• prEN 1856-2 rev — metal flue liners and connecting flue pipes (under development)<br>• prEN 13384-2 rev — thermal and fluid dynamic calculation methods Part 2 (stage 40.10, target Jan 2026)</p><p><strong>Standardisation request:</strong> Not yet adopted.

Self-standing chimneys (EN 13084 series) will be covered by a separate standardisation request for facade fire testing standards, planned for <strong>2027</strong>. The CPR acquis sub-group for chimneys has not yet formally started but is expected to complete work in 2026. The future SReq will be issued under <strong>CPR 2024/3110</strong> (new regulation), replacing the old mandate M/105.</p><p><strong>DPP outlook:</strong> The current harmonised standards (hENs under M/105) and old-regime EADs are all under CPR 305/2011 — DPP does not apply to products placed on the market under these. The ongoing TC-driven standard revisions likewise do not trigger DPP. <strong>DPP will only apply once new harmonised technical specifications are adopted under the forthcoming standardisation request under CPR 2024/3110.</strong> With the request expected around <strong>Q3 2026</strong> and standards delivery around <strong>2028</strong>, the mandatory adoption and coexistence period would bring the HTS into force around 2030 to 2031. DPP is estimated around <strong>~2031–2032</strong>.</p>">

    data-info="<p><strong>About this family:</strong> Covers products used in road, airfield, and trafficked-area construction, including asphalt and bituminous mixtures, paving-grade and polymer-modified bitumen, slurry surfacing, surface dressing, cold-applied joint sealants, road marking materials, concrete pavements, and hydraulically bound and unbound mixtures. The product scope is large, with around 25 harmonised standards. Standardisation is led by CEN/TC 227, with CEN/TC 336 (bituminous binders) and CEN/TC 226 (road equipment) contributing related standards.</p><p><strong>Current harmonised standards:</strong> ~25 harmonised standards cited in OJ under CPR 305/2011. AVCP per Commission Decision 98/601/EC (13 Oct 1998). Key series: EN 13108-1 to -9 (bituminous mixture specs), EN 13108-20/-21 (type testing/FPC), EN 12591 (paving bitumen), EN 14023 (polymer modified bitumen), EN 12273 (slurry surfacing), EN 12274 (surface dressing), EN 14188 (joint sealants), EN 1436/EN 1871 (road markings), EN 13877 (concrete pavements), EN 14227 (hydraulically bound mixtures), EN 13285 (unbound mixtures).</p><p><strong>Standards in development:</strong> No CPR-mandated standard revisions currently under way. The CPR acquis process has not yet started for this family, so no standardisation-request-driven revisions are in the CEN/TC 227 pipeline.</p><p><strong>Standardisation request:</strong> Not adopted. No draft on CIRCABC. Per <a href=&quot;https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/circabc-ewpp/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/1e989b50-3020-406b-9add-f847fc26de49/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>COM(2025) 772</a> (First CPR Working Plan 2026–2029), the acquis process targets: Milestone I (scope) <strong>Q1 2026</strong>, Milestone III (essential characteristics) <strong>Q3 2026</strong>, standardisation request <strong>2027</strong>. The future SReq will be under <strong>CPR 2024/3110</strong> (new regulation). Road construction is in the later priority group), with acquis work not yet started.</p><p><strong>DPP outlook:</strong> The future standardisation request will be issued under CPR 2024/3110, so the resulting standards will directly trigger DPP obligations. With the request expected in <strong>2027</strong> and standards development taking an estimated 24 to 30 months, the binding constraint is the time needed to bring the harmonised technical specification into force. DPP is estimated around <strong>~2032–2033</strong>.</p>"

    data-info="<p><strong>About this family:</strong> This is a new product family introduced in CPR 2024/3110, covering permanently attached ladders fixed to buildings and other construction works. This includes fixed roof ladders, vertical access ladders on facades and building exteriors, caged and uncaged maintenance access ladders, and fixed ladders in utility shafts. Related roof access products such as walkways, treads and safety hooks are also in scope. Portable ladders, loft ladders, and machinery access ladders are excluded. No dedicated technical committee has been assigned; existing standards are under CEN/TC 128 (roof covering products).</p><p><strong>Existing harmonised standards:</strong> Three standards currently cited under CPR 305/2011 in <strong>product family 22</strong> (Roof Coverings) via Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/451 — all AVCP System 3: (1) <strong>EN 12951:2004</strong> — permanently fixed roof ladders on pitched roofs (closest existing standard to family 36 scope); (2) <strong>EN 516:2006</strong> — roof access walkways, treads and steps; (3) <strong>EN 517:2006</strong> — roof safety hooks and anchorage points. Under CPR 2024/3110, these may be reclassified from family 22 to family 36. Related standards under other legislation: EN ISO 14122-4:2016 (fixed ladders for machinery — Machinery Regulation), EN 353-1:2014+A1:2017 (guided fall arresters on fixed ladders — PPE Regulation).</p><p><strong>Standards gap:</strong> EN 12951 covers only roof ladders on pitched roofs. Family 36&apos;s broader scope (facade ladders, utility access ladders, caged ladders) has no existing harmonised standards. New standards will need to be developed — likely via CEN mandate rather than EOTA EAD route, creating a potentially different pathway from the rest of family 34 (KAS).</p><p><strong>Standardisation request:</strong> Not yet adopted. No independent milestone data in Table 3 — family 36 is handled within family 34 (KAS) per <a href=&quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2025:772:FIN&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>COM(2025) 772</a>. KAS milestones: M-I Q2 2026, M-III Q2 2027, SReq 2027. Table 3 notes &quot;may be divided in several workstreams&quot; — ladders could follow a separate timeline from KAS&apos;s main EOTA-based track.</p><p><strong>DPP outlook:</strong> The DPP timeline depends on family 34 (KAS), under which attached ladders are grouped in the CPR Working Plan. The regulatory situation is complicated because existing standards currently sit under family 22 (roof coverings), and related products fall under the Machinery and PPE Regulations, which may require careful scoping work. If ladders get a separate CEN-based workstream, the timeline could diverge from the main KAS track. DPP is estimated around <strong>~2031–2032</strong>.</p>"

    data-info="<p><strong>About this family:</strong> Covers three distinct product groups: reinforcing steel (weldable bars, coils, and welded fabric for concrete reinforcement), prestressing steel (wire, strand, and bars), and post-tensioning kits (complete systems with tensile elements, anchorages, ducts, and filling material). Also includes stainless steel reinforcement. This is the only product family where the main harmonised standard was withdrawn, meaning reinforcing steel currently cannot be CE marked in the EU. Standardisation is led by CEN/TC 459/SC 4.</p><p><strong>Harmonised standards — unique situation:</strong> This is the <strong>only product family where the main harmonised standard was withdrawn from the OJ</strong>. EN 10080:2005 was withdrawn by <a href=&quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32006D0893&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>Commission Decision 2006/893/EC</a> because its &quot;framework&quot; approach left technical classes to national standards, making CE marking impossible. Since 2008, reinforcing steel <strong>cannot be CE marked</strong> in the EU. Prestressing steel (EN 10138 series) has been stuck at prEN stage for 20+ years and was never cited in the OJ. Only post-tensioning kits have a functioning CE marking route via ETAs under <a href=&quot;https://www.eota.eu/eads&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>EAD 160004-00-0301</a> and EAD 160027-00-0301 (cited OJ C 435/07, 15 Dec 2017), AVCP System 1+.

Assigned placeholder &quot;M/XXX&quot; — no mandate number yet. Target adoption Q2 2026. Delivery 2029, standard mandatory + DA 2029. Product requirements delegated act under discussion.

    data-info="<p><strong>About this family:</strong> The largest insulation product family under the CPR, covering factory-made thermal insulation products across 13 material types including mineral wool, expanded and extruded polystyrene, rigid polyurethane, phenolic foam, cellular glass, wood wool, wood fibre, expanded cork, expanded perlite, polyethylene, and calcium silicate. Also includes external thermal insulation composite systems (ETICS) assessed via the EAD route, vacuum insulation panels, and reflective insulation. This is a substantial market, valued at approximately USD 21 billion globally. Standardisation is led by CEN/TC 88.</p><p><strong>Current harmonised standards:</strong> 13 hENs for factory-made products: EN 13162–13171 series (one per insulation type) plus EN 14063-1, EN 16069, and EN 16977. All cited under old CPR 305/2011 via mandate M/103 (last OJ citation: OJ C 092, 2018 / Implementing Decision 2019/451). <strong>Important correction:</strong> EN 13499 and EN 13500 (ETICS with EPS/mineral wool) are <em>not</em> cited in the Official Journal and never functioned as true harmonised standards — ETICS products use the EAD/ETA route instead. AVCP: System 3/4 for factory-made products (Decision 99/91/EC); System 1 for ETICS (Decision <a href=&quot;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eudn/2011/14/contents&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>97/556/EC, amended by 2011/14/EU</a>).</p><p><strong>ETICS dual pathway:</strong> ETICS kits currently rely exclusively on the EAD/ETA route. ETAG 004 was fully converted to <strong>EAD 040083-01-0404</strong> in 2025, with approximately 798 valid ETAs. A future harmonised product standard — <strong>EN 17237</strong> — is in development by CEN/TC 88/WG 18 under mandate M/489, but is estimated to be 7+ years from completion. No harmonised facade fire test exists at EU level — national divergence persists (BS 8414 UK, DIN 4102-20 DE, LEPIR 2 FR). The European Association for ETICS (EAE) represents &gt;80% of Europe&apos;s ETICS revenue. Around 15–20 active EADs cover innovative products including VIPs, aerogels, and bio-based insulation.</p><p><strong>Standardisation request:</strong> In preparation — targeted <strong>Q3 2026</strong> per <a href=&quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52025DC0772&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>COM(2025) 772</a> Table 3. Not yet notified under Art. 12 (as of Feb 2026). Acquis Milestone I (scope definition) finished; Milestone III (technical content for SReq + delegated acts) ongoing. Product requirements delegated act under discussion. The SReq will be under <strong>CPR 2024/3110</strong> (new CPR), meaning DPP obligations apply directly once the resulting HTS is in force. Separately, the horizontal <a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/growth/feed?tpa_id=30046&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>dangerous substances SReq</a> (CEN/TC 351) was notified 1 Sep 2025 and covers all families including TIP — key substances: HBCDD, formaldehyde, biocides, mineral fibres. M/103 (mid-1990s) will be superseded by the new SReq.</p><p><strong>Environmental &amp; sustainability:</strong> EN 16783:2024 (EPD Product Category Rules for insulation) published. GWP declaration becomes mandatory from January 2026 under CPR 2024/3110. AVS delegated act circulated to Member States July 2025. ESPR: thermal insulation is <strong>not</strong> on the first priority product list (2025–2030 working plan) — CPR 2024/3110 is the primary instrument for environmental performance requirements. No dual ESPR/CPR DPP obligation expected in the near term (ESPR mid-term review in 2028 could add construction products).</p><p><strong>DPP outlook:</strong> The standardisation request is expected in <strong>Q3 2026</strong> under CPR 2024/3110, so the resulting standards will directly trigger DPP obligations with no transitional gap between the old and new regime. Standards delivery is targeted for <strong>2029</strong>, with the harmonised technical specification expected in force around 2030. DPP is estimated around <strong>~2029–2030</strong>, making thermal insulation one of the earliest families likely to require a digital product passport.</p>"

    data-info="<p><strong>About this family:</strong> One of the broadest product families, spanning electronic fire detection and alarm systems, fixed sprinkler and gas extinguishing components, smoke and heat control systems, fire dampers, fire hydrants, hose reels, residential sprinklers, and explosion suppression equipment. Four European Assessment Documents cover specialty products. Standardisation is shared across multiple technical committees: <a href=&quot;https://standards.iteh.ai/catalog/tc/cen/25b641b4-937d-4ab0-8db6-768af16d1453/cen-tc-191&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>CEN/TC 191</a> (fixed firefighting), <a href=&quot;https://standards.iteh.ai/catalog/tc/cen/6c7335ad-adf5-4c3f-a2b6-ee55036462f3/cen-tc-72&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>CEN/TC 72</a> (fire detection and alarm), CEN/TC 295 (residential sprinklers), and CEN/TC 305 (explosion suppression), with <a href=&quot;https://www.euralarm.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>Euralarm</a> as the key industry body.</p><p><strong>Current harmonised standards:</strong> ~32 harmonised standards cited under old CPR 305/2011 via mandate M/109 (OJ C 092/2018, Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/451). <a href=&quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:31996D0577&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>AVCP per Decision 96/577/EC</a>: <strong>System 1 for ALL products</strong> (most stringent — NB certification required). EN 54 citation backlog: 6+ technically sound standards remain uncited since ~2014 due to James Elliott ruling fallout. Euralarm notes CPR covers &quot;asphalt to electronic systems&quot; under one framework — fire safety needs faster standards update cycles than the current process delivers.</p><p><strong>Standardisation request:</strong> Acquis NOT started. M-I targeted Q2 2026, M-III Q1 2027, SReq Q3 2027 per <a href=&quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2025:772:FIN&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>COM(2025) 772</a> Table 3. No Art. 12 notification found. Under CPR 2024/3110 (DPP applies directly). No standards delivery date set — the breadth of this family (dual TC, ~32 existing hENs) means development will take 3-4 years minimum. EFSN confirms CEN/TC 191/WG 5 has NOT begun revising sprinkler hENs — waiting for the SReq.</p><p><strong>Multi-directive &amp; environmental:</strong> Fire detection products uniquely fall under CPR + EMC (2014/30/EU) + LVD (2014/35/EU) + RoHS (2011/65/EU) + WEEE (2012/19/EU) + <a href=&quot;https://www.euralarm.org/resource/euralarm-publishes-fact-sheet-on-cyber-resilience-act-classification-for-fire-safety-and-security-products.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>Cyber Resilience Act</a> (from Dec 2027). No fire-safety-specific EPD PCR exists — active systems have unique LCA challenges (module B6 operational energy over 15-25 year lifespan, electronic end-of-life). Apollo Fire Detectors targeting EPDs by 2030 using CIBSE TM65 as interim. ESPR: fire safety NOT on priority list but horizontal EEE repairability measures (~2027) could capture electronic detection products.</p><p><strong>DPP outlook:</strong> The standardisation request is targeted for <strong>Q3 2027</strong>, with standards development expected to take three to four years due to dual-TC coordination and the breadth of this family. DPP is estimated around <strong>~2032–2033</strong>, making it one of the later families. The key constraints are the worst standards citation track record in all of CPR, extreme product heterogeneity (electronic to mechanical), and the risk of duplicate DPP obligations if CPR and ESPR frameworks are not harmonised for electronic fire detection products.</p>"

    data-info="<p><strong>About this family:</strong> One of the most fragmented product families, covering internal and external wall cladding, ceiling finishes, and internal partition kits. Products range from fibre-cement sheets, metal cladding, and sandwich panels to suspended ceilings, decorative wallcoverings, natural stone cladding, wood panelling, and high-pressure laminates. Standardisation is spread across seven or more technical committees, primarily <a href=&quot;https://standards.iteh.ai/catalog/tc/cen/56c5e14c-1681-4e4a-9fb3-330f8cec4d06/cen-tc-128&quot;>CEN/TC 128</a> (roof and wall cladding), with secondary roles for CEN/TC 277 (suspended ceilings), CEN/TC 241 (gypsum), CEN/TC 99 (wallcoverings), CEN/TC 246 (natural stone), CEN/TC 175 (wood panelling), and CEN/TC 134 (high-pressure laminates).</p><p><strong>Current harmonised standards &amp; AVCP:</strong> ~22 hENs cited under CPR 305/2011 via mandate <a href=&quot;https://standards.iteh.ai/catalog/mandate/cen/40a03bb7-604b-4a68-979d-0cd0d4d5dc3b/m-121&quot;>M/121</a> (OJ C 092/2018, Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/451). AVCP per <a href=&quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:31998D0437&quot;>Commission Decision 98/437/EC</a> (amended by 2001/596/EC): System 1 for reaction-to-fire classes A1–C (NB certification), System 3 for fire classes D–F and fire protection panels, System 4 for other uses (acoustic, thermal, moisture). Significant scope overlap with PF 22 (roof coverings — many standards dual-listed), PF 7 (gypsum — EN 14195/EN 13950), PF 19 (floorings — EN 14411 ceramics), PF 20 (structural metallic — EN 14509 sandwich panels). Note: wallpaper (EN 15102/CEN/TC 99) may be separated into a new family &quot;Decorative paints and wallpapers&quot; under CPR 2024/3110. No EADs in product area 21.</p><p><strong>Fire safety &amp; post-Grenfell:</strong> Reaction to fire is the dominant performance characteristic — drives AVCP system assignment. New EU facade fire test standard effective Jan 2026 (temperature-based measurement replacing visual assessment, 7 years in development). Post-Grenfell (UK Phase 2 report Sep 2024): UK extending combustible materials ban to buildings &gt;11m (Sep 2025, Euroclass A2 minimum for external facades). 14 EU member states have national fire deviations beyond the Euroclass system. UK Construction Products Reform Green Paper (Feb 2025) proposes a &quot;Construction Library&quot; central repository — proto-DPP concept.</p><p><strong>Standardisation request:</strong> Not yet adopted.

No standards delivery or mandatory adoption dates set yet. The future SReq will be issued under <strong>CPR 2024/3110</strong>.</p><p><strong>DPP outlook:</strong> The standardisation request is targeted for <strong>2028</strong>, but the coordination challenge across seven or more technical committees makes this one of the most complex families to standardise. DPP is estimated around <strong>~2032–2033</strong>. Major manufacturers like Saint-Gobain and Knauf are already DPP-ready through existing EPD and BIM infrastructure, but the sheer fragmentation of this family and the absence of delivery dates in Table 3 remain the key constraints.</p>"

    data-info="<p><strong>About this family:</strong> Covers all gypsum-based construction products including plasterboards, fibreboards, gypsum blocks, plasters, fibrous casts, composite panels, reprocessed gypsum products, metal framing for drylining systems, and ceiling elements. Two European Assessment Documents address structural/load-bearing plasterboard. A complete drylining or partition system involves boards, framing, fasteners, jointing, and adhesives, each with separate standards. Standardisation is led by <a href=&quot;https://standards.iteh.ai/catalog/tc/cen/9483f6b8-0477-4ec1-b720-d8020a6f32f8/cen-tc-241&quot;>CEN/TC 241</a> (Gypsum products).</p><p><strong>AVCP &amp; fire classification:</strong> One of the lightest AVCP regimes among all 37 product families. Per <a href=&quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec/1995/467/oj/eng&quot;>Commission Decision 95/467/EC</a> (amended 2002/592/EC): System 3/4 for most products — manufacturer self-declaration. System 1 only for fire-critical products (composite panels, fibrous casts, jointing, metal framing). Gypsum (mineral) classified A1 without testing per Decision 96/603/EC — inherent fire safety guaranteed by material composition (paper liner ≤220 g/m² → A2-s1,d0 per EN 520 Annex B). This is a key competitive advantage: fire performance is a selling point rather than a compliance burden.</p><p><strong>Circularity &amp; sustainability:</strong> Gypsum is 100% recyclable with no property loss, yet only ~13% post-consumer recycled (87% to landfill). Unique challenge: gypsum in mixed landfill produces toxic H₂S gas (UK banned co-disposal 2005). FGD synthetic gypsum declining as Europe decarbonises — urgency to increase C&amp;D recycling. Siniat <strong>RECYPLAC</strong>: world&apos;s first 100% recycled gypsum plasterboard (Jul 2025). EU LIFE GtoG project demonstrated 30% recycled content. Industry: <a href=&quot;https://eurogypsum.org/&quot;>Eurogypsum</a> (EUR 7.7B turnover, 154 quarries, 160 factories). Three European producers — Knauf, Saint-Gobain, Etex — control ~47% of global wallboard capacity. EPDs well-established (IBU Part B PCR for plasterboard). BIM-ready: Knauf Plug-in 2025, Saint-Gobain BIM portal.</p><p><strong>Standardisation request:</strong> Not yet adopted. Per <a href=&quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2025:772:FIN&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>COM(2025) 772</a> Table 3: Milestone I (product scope) targeted <strong>Q3 2026</strong>, Milestone III (essential characteristics) targeted <strong>Q3 2027</strong>, standardisation request targeted <strong>2028</strong>.

DPP is estimated around <strong>~2032–2033</strong>. The gypsum industry is well-positioned through existing EPD and BIM infrastructure from major producers like Knauf, Saint-Gobain, and Etex. The key DPP data dimension will be circularity: gypsum is 100% recyclable without property loss, yet only about 13% is recycled post-consumer today.</p>"

    data-info="<p><strong>About this family:</strong> One of the most compact CPR families, covering structural bearings used in bridges and buildings — including sliding, elastomeric, roller, pot, rocker, spherical PTFE, and guide/restraint bearings — plus pins for structural joints. Six European Assessment Documents address innovative bearing materials, reflecting material innovation outpacing the standard revision cycle. Standardisation is led by <a href=&quot;https://standards.iteh.ai/catalog/tc/cen/fd914aa4-206a-4c25-9f79-0b9b7543d1dd/cen-tc-167&quot;>CEN/TC 167</a> (Structural bearings). Anti-seismic devices are a separate product family.</p><p><strong>AVCP &amp; Eurocode connection:</strong> Per <a href=&quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec/1995/467/oj/eng&quot;>Decision 95/467/EC</a>: System 1 for critical bearings (failure consequences beyond limit states — most bridge bearings), System 3 for non-critical. Second-generation Eurocodes deepening integration: EN 1990 adding new Annex F specifically for bearing design (migrating from EN 1993-2 informative Annex A). EN 1998-2 (seismic bridges) references both EN 1337 and EN 15129 — manufacturers must navigate two TCs and two AVCP regimes.</p><p><strong>Industry &amp; infrastructure:</strong> Oligopolistic niche — no dedicated European trade association. Key manufacturers: mageba (CH), Maurer (DE), FIP MEC (IT), Freyssinet/VINCI (FR), Trelleborg (SE). DIBt (Germany) is the leading TAB. Market ~USD 180M (Europe). Infrastructure-driven: 200,000+ railway bridges in EU, most &gt;50 years old. Bearings last 30–50 years vs bridge lifespan 75–120 years → replaced 1–3 times per bridge. Demand weighted toward replacement/maintenance. EPD at ground zero: first externally verified EPD published Dec 2024 (<a href=&quot;https://manage.epdhub.com/declarations/metal-based-products/mageba-services-technologies-ag/3046/reston-spherical-bearing/&quot;>mageba RESTON SPHERICAL</a>, EPD Hub). No bearing-specific PCR exists.</p><p><strong>Standardisation request:</strong> Not yet adopted.

No standards delivery or mandatory adoption dates set yet. The future SReq will be issued under <strong>CPR 2024/3110</strong>.</p><p><strong>DPP outlook:</strong> The standardisation request is targeted for <strong>2028</strong>, with no delivery or mandatory dates yet in Table 3. DPP is estimated around <strong>~2032–2033</strong>. The compact standard set and small number of manufacturers should make implementation technically straightforward once required. The key constraint is EPD immaturity: the sector's first externally verified EPD was only published in December 2024, meaning sustainability data infrastructure is still underdeveloped.</p>"

With 32 European Assessment Documents it has the second-highest EAD count across all 37 families, including green roof kits and recycled plastic roofing.

Separate Decision 2000/553/EC governs external fire performance of roof coverings (B<sub>ROOF</sub> classification — a characteristic unique to roofing). EN 13501-5 classifies external fire exposure to roofs.

The future SReq will be issued under <strong>CPR 2024/3110</strong>.</p><p><strong>DPP outlook:</strong> The standardisation request is targeted for <strong>2028</strong>, but with 21 harmonised standards to revise across CEN/TC 128 (shared with the WCF family) and no delivery date in Table 3, development will be substantial. DPP is estimated around <strong>~2032–2033</strong>. EPD maturity is moderate, with manufacturers like Wienerberger and BMI Group already publishing EPDs, but the key constraint is the sheer breadth of revisions required and the absence of a roofing-specific product category rule.</p>"

    data-info="<p><strong>About this family:</strong> Covers safety-critical road infrastructure including vehicle restraint barriers, fixed and variable road signs, traffic signal heads, warning lights, lighting columns, road marking materials, noise barriers, and anti-glare screens. Eleven European Assessment Documents extend the scope into bridge expansion joints and specialty products. Standardisation is led by CEN/TC 226 (Road equipment), which also has a newer working group on road infrastructure interactions with autonomous vehicles.</p><p><strong>AVCP &amp; safety:</strong> Commission Decision 96/579/EC — System 1 for 80% of standards (12 of 15), reflecting the safety-critical nature of road equipment. Only anti-glare screens and noise barriers carry System 3. No System 4 at all. EN 1317 has 8 parts but only Part 5 is harmonised; Parts 4/7 are under revision (splitting terminal/transition standards), Part 6 is a Technical Report (pedestrian parapets), Part 8 is a Technical Specification (motorcycle restraints). EN 1317-5 demands full-scale vehicle crash tests at speeds up to 110 km/h — one of the most physically demanding test regimes in all of CPR. Milestone 0 already ongoing for a new road restraint assessment method — a unique pre-acquis step where the Commission is developing methodology before formal standardisation begins. Environmental Noise Directive 2002/49/EC creates a parallel demand driver for EN 14388 noise barriers through mandatory noise action plans.</p><p><strong>Bridge joints &amp; multi-directive:</strong> 7 of 11 EADs cover bridge expansion joints (EAD 120011 flexible plug, 120093 asphaltic plug, 120109 nosing, 120110 mat, 120111 cantilever, 120112 supported, 120113 modular) — the family extends well beyond road-surface equipment into bridge infrastructure, overlapping with SBE (structural bearings). Other EADs: microprismatic retroreflective sheeting (120001), wood/metal lighting columns (120003/120017), road marking products (230011). Variable message signs (EN 12966) face multi-directive complexity similar to FFF: EMC Directive 2014/30/EU, Low Voltage Directive 2014/35/EU, and potentially Cyber Resilience Act for connected/IoT signage. The IRMA working group on automated mobility signals future standards for V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure) road equipment — a growth area for intelligent road infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Standardisation request:</strong> Not yet adopted.

DPP is estimated around <strong>~2032–2033</strong>. The European Union Road Federation supports fast-track CPR acquis for road equipment. The key constraint is low EPD maturity across the sector, though ArcelorMittal has published IBU-verified EPDs for steel road barriers and LED road lighting EPDs exist.</p>"

    data-info="<p><strong>About this family:</strong> Covers concrete admixtures, mineral additions (fly ash, blast furnace slag, silica fume), fibres (steel and polymer), pigments, and the full range of concrete repair products — but notably excludes ready-mixed concrete itself, since the core concrete specification is not harmonised under CPR. Nineteen European Assessment Documents represent the frontier of low-carbon concrete innovation, including steel fibres from end-of-life tyres, FRP reinforcement bars, and calcined clay for low-carbon cements. Standardisation is led by CEN/TC 104 (Concrete and related products), with a close relationship to CEN/TC 51 (Cement).</p><p><strong>AVCP &amp; complexity:</strong> Commission Decision 1999/469/EC — the most AVCP-complex family: EN 1504 repair products carry up to 4 different systems (1, 2+, 3, 4) depending on the characteristic. System 1+ for mineral additions (fly ash, slag, silica fume — safety-critical as they modify concrete strength). System 2+ for admixtures (EN 934 series) and pigments. System 1/3 for fibres (structural vs non-structural use). System 4 only for non-structural surface protection. The acquis work (Milestone I: ongoing, Milestone III: Q1 2026) could bring EN 206 into CPR scope for the first time — potentially transformational for the ~EUR 80B European ready-mixed concrete market.</p><p><strong>Circularity &amp; innovation:</strong> 19 EADs show strong circular economy innovation: EAD 260010 (steel fibres recovered from end-of-life tyres), EAD 260009 (MSWI bottom ash as concrete addition), EAD 260023 (carbon/glass/basalt/aramid FRP reinforcement bars — alternative to steel), EAD 260014 (calcined clay as type II addition — key for LC3 low-carbon cements), EAD 260020 (catalytic calcium carbonate), EAD 260006 (polymeric addition), EAD 260035 (natural calcined pozzolana). Also includes FRP structural sections (260001), inorganic fibre grid reinforcement (260057), and zinc anode cathodic protection systems (260100). Many of these EADs represent the frontier of low-carbon concrete technology.</p><p><strong>DPP outlook:</strong> This family is more advanced than most, with acquis work already underway and the standardisation request targeted for <strong>Q4 2026</strong>. DPP is estimated around <strong>~2030–2031</strong>. The key open question is whether the standardisation request will bring the core concrete specification into CPR scope for the first time — if so, DPP impact would be massive, potentially covering ~76 million digital passports per year for ready-mixed concrete alone.</p>"

Key standard series include EN 13381 (fire protection to structural elements), EN 1366 (fire resistance of service installations), and EN 1634 (fire resistance of door/shutter assemblies), all under AVCP System 1.

Based on the Table 3 timeline — SReq <strong>2029</strong>, followed by an estimated 24–36 months for standards development, mandatory adoption, and coexistence — the harmonised technical specifications could enter into force around 2032. DPP is estimated around <strong>~2030–2031</strong>, though the late start on acquis work and the absence of delivery targets suggest the upper end of this range is more likely.</p>">

    data-info="<p><strong>About this family:</strong> Covers mechanical fasteners such as anchors, bolts, and screws, as well as chemical anchors, post-installed rebar connections, and channel bolt systems for fixing to concrete, masonry, and other substrates. This family is primarily covered through European Technical Assessments (ETAs) issued by EOTA.</p><p><strong>Standardisation request:</strong> According to the Commission Working Plan (Table 3), Milestone I (product scope) and Milestone III (essential characteristics) are both planned for 2028. No standardisation request date has been set yet. Since fixings rely primarily on the ETA route (EADs rather than hENs), the transition depends on how EOTA adapts its assessment documents to the new CPR framework.</p><p><strong>DPP outlook:</strong> DPP obligations for fixings are estimated around 2032–2033. The expected path is: scope definition and essential characteristics (2028) → SReq → EAD/standard delivery → mandatory DA → coexistence → HTS in force → DPP. Key assessment documents likely in scope include EAD 330232 series (mechanical fasteners), EAD 330499 series (bonded fasteners), and EAD 330747 (post-installed rebar). Old-regime EADs (CPR 305/2011) do not trigger DPP — new EADs under CPR 2024/3110 are required. The harmonised standard timeline is the binding constraint.</p>">

<h2>What the DPP Must Contain</h2>

<p>Article 76 specifies the minimum information that must be accessible through a construction product's DPP:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="Blogs/cpr-digital-product-passport/dpp-minimum-content.svg" alt="Five categories of minimum DPP content under Article 76 of the Construction Products Regulation: Declaration of Performance and Conformity, Safety Information, Technical Documentation, Labels and Markings, and Unique Product Identifier — accessible free of charge via data carrier">
  <figcaption class="sr-only">
    <p>Under Article 76 of Regulation (EU) 2024/3110 (Construction Products Regulation), a Digital Product Passport must contain at minimum:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Declaration of Performance and Conformity (DoPC)</strong> — the central document certifying that a product meets the applicable harmonised technical specifications.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety Information</strong> — relevant to the product's intended use.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical Documentation</strong> — including test reports and assessment results.</li>
      <li><strong>Labels and Markings</strong> — product labels and CE markings.</li>
      <li><strong>Unique Product Identifier</strong> — enabling traceability across the supply chain.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Access must be provided free of charge via a data carrier (e.g. QR code) on the product or packaging, with differentiated access levels per stakeholder.</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Interoperability and Open Standards</h2>

<p>Articles 77 and 78 contain unusually explicit requirements for the DPP's technical architecture. The regulation mandates:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Open standards</strong> — data must be structured in open, machine-readable formats.</li>
  <li><strong>No vendor lock-in</strong> — the DPP system must not tie manufacturers or other economic operators to proprietary platforms.</li>
  <li><strong>Interoperability</strong> — the system must work across different software environments and be compatible with existing digital tools used in the construction sector, including <strong>Building Information Modelling (BIM)</strong> systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Data security and trade secrets</strong> — access controls must protect confidential business information while ensuring that regulators and market surveillance authorities can access the data they need.</li>
</ul>

<p>The emphasis on BIM compatibility is distinctive to the CPR and reflects the construction sector's existing digital infrastructure. It signals that the Commission sees the DPP not as a standalone compliance tool, but as a layer that integrates with how the industry already manages product data.</p>

<h2>What Should the Industry Do Now?</h2>

<p>Despite the uncertainty around exact dates, the direction is clear. Manufacturers and other economic operators in the construction sector should:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Map your products to the working plan.</strong> Identify which Annex VII product families your products fall under and check where those families sit in the Commission's rollout timeline. <a href="https://demos.regenstudio.space/cpr-dpp-tracker/gate.html" style="color: #00914B; font-weight: 600;">Our CPR DPP Tracker can help &rarr;</a></li>
  <li><strong>Start collecting and structuring product data.</strong> The DPP will require declarations of performance, safety information, technical documentation, and unique identifiers. Much of this data already exists but is often fragmented across different systems and formats.</li>
  <li><strong>Engage with CEN/CENELEC.</strong> If your product family's standardisation request has been adopted or is in preparation, the standards development process is already underway. Industry input — particularly from SMEs — is critical to ensuring the resulting specifications are both ambitious and workable.</li>
  <li><strong>Build DPP-ready data infrastructure.</strong> The regulation's emphasis on open standards, machine-readable formats, and BIM compatibility means that proprietary, siloed product data systems will not meet the requirements. Start investing in interoperable digital product data now.</li>
</ul>

<p>The CPR recast represents a generational shift in how construction products are documented, tracked, and verified across the EU market. The DPP is not an add-on — it is a core part of the new regulatory architecture. Getting ahead of it is not just good compliance; it is a competitive advantage.</p>

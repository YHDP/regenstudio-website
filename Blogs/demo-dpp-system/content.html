<p>Digital Product Passports (DPPs) are moving from policy documents to live infrastructure — but what does a real, end-to-end DPP system actually look like? Our interactive DPP System Demo answers that question by putting a complete passport in your hands: a traceable product journey, simulated verifiable credentials, and ESPR compliance data, all in one place.</p>

<h2>What the Demo Demonstrates</h2>

<p>The demo follows a piece of Brazilian hardwood furniture — from the certified forest where the timber was harvested, through the sawmill and manufacturing process, to the finished product ready for the European market. At each step, the DPP accumulates data: chain-of-custody certificates, carbon footprint measurements, material composition, repairability information, and end-of-life instructions.</p>

<p>Every claim in the demo is backed by a simulated <strong>UNTP (UN Transparency Protocol) verifiable credential</strong> — illustrating the emerging international standard for machine-readable, cryptographically verifiable supply chain attestations. This means you can see not just the data, but also how trust would be established: who issued each credential, what they certified, and how it links to the product record.</p>

<p>The compliance view maps the product's data against <a href="blog-post.html?post=ESPR">ESPR ecodesign requirements</a>, showing which fields are satisfied, which are pending, and what data gaps remain before market entry. This is the kind of readiness dashboard that product teams and compliance officers need as delegated acts roll out across product categories from 2026 onward.</p>

<h2>Who It Is For</h2>

<p><strong>Manufacturers and brands</strong> entering or expanding in the EU market will see exactly what a product-level DPP implementation requires — which data fields matter, how traceability is structured, and how compliance is reported.</p>

<p><strong>Policymakers and regulators</strong> working on ESPR delegated acts or DPP governance can use the demo to ground their policy discussions in a concrete, working example rather than theoretical frameworks.</p>

<p><strong>DPP implementers and technology providers</strong> — whether building DPP platforms, registries, or data connectors — can explore the architecture from the user perspective and understand how simulated UNTP credentials, product identifiers, and compliance layers interact.</p>

<p><strong>Supply chain partners</strong> at any tier — logistics, certification bodies, recyclers — will see how their data contributions fit into the larger passport and what access rights different actors have to different data layers.</p>

<h2>How to Use the Demo</h2>

<p>The demo is self-guided and requires no login or installation. Here is how to navigate it:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Enter through the gate.</strong> The gate page gives you a brief orientation and asks for your name and organisation. This is not a paywall — it helps us understand who is exploring the demo.</li>
  <li><strong>Explore the dashboard.</strong> After the gate, you land on the DPP system dashboard, showing the product portfolio and compliance status at a glance.</li>
  <li><strong>Open a product record.</strong> Select the Brazilian hardwood furniture piece to open its full DPP. You will see structured product data, material declarations, and the simulated UNTP credential chain.</li>
  <li><strong>Trace the supply chain.</strong> Follow the journey from certified forest to finished product, with each supply chain step linked to its simulated verifiable credential and the actor who would issue it.</li>
  <li><strong>Check ESPR compliance.</strong> Switch to the compliance view to see how the product's data maps against expected ESPR ecodesign requirements — and what a compliance gap looks like.</li>
</ol>

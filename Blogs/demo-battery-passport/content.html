<p>The EU Battery Regulation (EU 2023/1542) is the first piece of EU product legislation to mandate a Digital Product Passport — and it comes into effect for EV batteries and industrial batteries from February 2027. For many companies, the critical first question is simply: <em>does this apply to us?</em> Our Battery Passport Checker answers that question with a structured, interactive assessment — and produces a downloadable PDF report you can share with your compliance or legal team.</p>

<h2>Why the Battery Regulation Matters</h2>

<p>The Battery Regulation introduces obligations that go well beyond traditional product labelling. Companies placing batteries on the EU market — including manufacturers, importers, and authorised representatives — must disclose carbon footprints, recycled content, supply chain due diligence data, and end-of-life information, all structured within a machine-readable Battery Passport. The regulation applies to EV batteries, industrial batteries above 2 kWh, and LMT (light means of transport) batteries.</p>

<p>The compliance timeline is already in motion. Carbon footprint declarations are required from February 2025 for EV batteries, with the full Battery Passport obligation kicking in from February 2027. Getting an early read on your obligations is not optional — it is foundational to your product strategy.</p>

<h2>What the Demo Does</h2>

<p>The Battery Passport Checker is a structured questionnaire that walks you through the key compliance variables: battery category, capacity, market channel, role in the value chain, and existing data maturity. Based on your answers, the checker determines your obligation status — whether you are in scope, partially in scope, or exempt — and explains which specific requirements apply to you.</p>

<p>At the end of the assessment, you can download a <strong>PDF compliance report</strong> summarising your answers and the resulting obligation determination. This report is designed to be a useful starting document for internal discussions with legal, product, and supply chain teams.</p>

<h2>Who It Is For</h2>

<p><strong>Battery manufacturers</strong> — particularly those supplying EV, stationary storage, or industrial applications — will use the checker to map their obligations against the regulation's phased timeline and data requirements.</p>

<p><strong>EV companies and mobility platforms</strong> placing vehicles or battery systems on the EU market need to understand whether the Battery Passport obligation falls on them directly or on their battery supplier — and what data they need to collect regardless.</p>

<p><strong>Importers and authorised representatives</strong> acting as the responsible party for non-EU manufacturers need clarity on which obligations transfer to them under the regulation's market access rules.</p>

<p><strong>Legal and compliance teams</strong> within companies affected by the regulation will find the PDF report a useful briefing document for leadership and board-level conversations about regulatory readiness.</p>

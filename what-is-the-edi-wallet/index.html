      <h1>What is the European Digital Identity Wallet?</h1>
      <p class="qa-article__capsule"><strong>The <dfn><abbr title="European Digital Identity">EDI</abbr> Wallet (European Digital Identity Wallet)</dfn> is a secure mobile app under <dfn><abbr title="electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services">eIDAS</abbr> 2.0</dfn> enabling EU citizens to store identity credentials, verify themselves cross-border, and control their personal data.</strong></p>

      <section id="edi-intro">
        <h2>What is the European Digital Identity Wallet?</h2>
        <p>The European Digital Identity Wallet is a secure mobile application that every EU member state must offer its citizens under the <abbr title="electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services">eIDAS</abbr> 2.0 regulation (Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) 2024/1183). It allows individuals to store identity credentials — such as national ID, driving licence, diplomas, and professional qualifications — in digital form, present them selectively to verifiers, and sign documents electronically. The wallet puts users in control of their personal data and works across borders and sectors throughout the EU.</p>
        <p>Think of the <abbr title="European Digital Identity">EDI</abbr> Wallet as a digital version of the documents you carry in your physical wallet — but with a critical difference. Instead of handing over your entire ID card, you can share only the specific information a verifier needs. A bar can confirm you are over 18 without learning your name or address. An employer can verify your degree without accessing your medical records. This principle of <strong>selective disclosure</strong> is at the heart of the EDI Wallet's design.</p>
        <p>The EDI Wallet is not a single app built by the European Commission. Each member state develops or procures its own wallet implementation, but all must meet common technical standards and interoperability requirements defined in eIDAS 2.0 implementing acts. This means a wallet issued in the Netherlands must be accepted in Portugal, and vice versa.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="edi-eidas">
        <h2>What does eIDAS 2.0 require for EDI Wallets?</h2>
        <p><abbr title="electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services">eIDAS</abbr> 2.0 (Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) 2024/1183) is the revised European framework for electronic identification and trust services. It updates the original <time datetime="2014">2014</time> eIDAS regulation with a much broader scope and a new centrepiece: the European Digital Identity Wallet. The regulation sets out detailed requirements that every wallet must satisfy.</p>
        <p>Key requirements under eIDAS 2.0 include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Universal availability</strong> — all 27 EU member states must issue an <abbr title="European Digital Identity">EDI</abbr> Wallet to any citizen or resident who requests one, free of charge</li>
          <li><strong>Voluntary use</strong> — no one can be forced to use a wallet; it must remain an option alongside traditional identification methods</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-border interoperability</strong> — wallets issued by any member state must be recognised and accepted across the entire EU</li>
          <li><strong>Selective disclosure</strong> — users must be able to share individual data fields rather than entire credentials, minimising the personal data exposed in any transaction</li>
          <li><strong>Qualified electronic signatures</strong> — the wallet must enable users to create qualified electronic signatures and seals, giving digital signatures the same legal standing as handwritten ones</li>
          <li><strong>Relying party obligations</strong> — large online platforms with over 45 million <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> users must accept EDI Wallets for user authentication</li>
          <li><strong>Trust framework</strong> — wallets operate within a regulated trust framework, with certified issuers, verifiers, and wallet providers subject to security and conformity requirements</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy by design</strong> — wallet providers must not be able to track users' transactions, and wallet data must be stored locally on the user's device or in user-controlled secure storage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The implementing acts specifying the detailed technical architecture, security standards, and certification requirements are being developed by the European Commission alongside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Digital Identity Wallet Consortium.

      <section id="edi-how-it-works">
        <h2>How does an EDI Wallet work?</h2>
        <p>The EDI Wallet operates on a <strong>three-party model</strong> — issuers, holders, and verifiers — that decouples the moment of credential issuance from the moment of credential presentation. This is what makes the wallet fundamentally different from traditional identity verification, where a verifier typically contacts a central database.</p>
        <p>The wallet interaction flow works as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Issuance</strong> — a trusted issuer (such as a government agency, university, or employer) creates a <a href="#edi-verifiable-credentials">verifiable credential</a> and delivers it to the holder's wallet. For example, a municipality issues a proof-of-residence credential after verifying the holder's address.</li>
          <li><strong>Storage</strong> — the holder stores the credential locally in their wallet app on their own device. The credential is cryptographically signed by the issuer, making it tamper-proof.</li>
          <li><strong>Presentation</strong> — when a verifier (such as a bank, airline, or online service) requests proof of identity or a specific attribute, the holder selects which credentials or individual data fields to share. The wallet generates a verifiable presentation containing only the requested information.</li>
          <li><strong>Verification</strong> — the verifier cryptographically confirms the credential's authenticity using the issuer's public key. This happens instantly and <strong>without contacting the issuer</strong> — preserving the holder's privacy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A practical example: when renting a car, the rental company requests proof that you hold a valid driving licence and are over 25. Your wallet presents only those two facts — licence validity and age confirmation — without revealing your home address, date of birth, or any other personal data. Try this interaction pattern yourself in our <a href="../blog/demo-edi-wallet/">EDI Wallet demo</a>.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="edi-verifiable-credentials">
        <h2>What are Verifiable Credentials?</h2>
        <p><dfn>Verifiable Credentials</dfn> are tamper-proof, cryptographically signed digital statements issued by a trusted party. They are the fundamental data unit stored in an <abbr title="European Digital Identity">EDI</abbr> Wallet — each credential represents a specific claim about the holder, such as their identity, a qualification, a licence, or a proof of address.</p>
        <p>A verifiable credential consists of three elements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Claims</strong> — the actual data (e.g., "name: Maria Santos", "degree: MSc Computer Science", "issuer: University of Lisbon")</li>
          <li><strong>Metadata</strong> — information about the credential itself (when it was issued, when it expires, what standard it follows)</li>
          <li><strong>Cryptographic proof</strong> — a digital signature from the issuer that allows anyone to verify the credential has not been altered</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The power of verifiable credentials lies in what they enable: <strong>trust without centralisation</strong>. A verifier does not need to contact the issuing university to confirm a diploma. The cryptographic signature proves the credential is genuine, was issued by the stated authority, and has not been tampered with. Combined with selective disclosure, verifiable credentials allow you to prove specific claims (e.g., "I am over 18") without revealing the underlying data (your full date of birth).</p>
        <p>Verifiable credentials follow open standards — primarily the <strong>W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model</strong> and <strong>ISO/IEC 18013-5</strong> (for mobile driving licences). The eIDAS 2.0 implementing acts define which credential formats the <abbr title="European Digital Identity">EDI</abbr> Wallet must support to ensure cross-border interoperability.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="edi-ssi">
        <h2>What is Self-Sovereign Identity and how does it relate to EDI Wallets?</h2>
        <p><dfn><abbr title="Self-Sovereign Identity">SSI</abbr> (Self-Sovereign Identity)</dfn> is a model where individuals own and control their digital identity without depending on a central authority. Instead of a platform or government holding your data and deciding what to share, you hold cryptographically signed credentials in your own wallet and choose when and with whom to share them.</p>
        <p><abbr title="Self-Sovereign Identity">SSI</abbr> relies on technologies like <strong><abbr title="Decentralized Identifiers">DID</abbr>s (Decentralized Identifiers)</strong> — globally unique identifiers created and controlled by the subject rather than a central registry — and verifiable credentials to enable trust without centralisation. The core principles of SSI include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>User control</strong> — the individual decides what data to share, with whom, and for how long</li>
          <li><strong>Portability</strong> — credentials are not locked into a single platform or provider</li>
          <li><strong>Selective disclosure</strong> — share only the minimum data necessary for each interaction</li>
          <li><strong>Decentralisation</strong> — no single point of control or failure in the identity system</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy by default</strong> — interactions reveal as little as possible about the holder</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <abbr title="European Digital Identity">EDI</abbr> Wallet incorporates key <abbr title="Self-Sovereign Identity">SSI</abbr> principles — selective disclosure, user control, and credential portability — but stops short of full decentralisation. Wallets are issued by EU member states, not self-created, and trust flows through government-approved certification schemes rather than decentralised trust registries. This pragmatic approach makes the wallet legally binding and widely deployable while preserving the user-centric philosophy of SSI.

        <h2>Who needs to prepare for EDI Wallets?</h2>
        <p>The <abbr title="European Digital Identity">EDI</abbr> Wallet is not just a government project — its impact extends to every organisation that verifies identity, issues credentials, or provides online services. <strong>Five groups of organisations</strong> need to prepare:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Government agencies</strong> — must develop and issue <abbr title="European Digital Identity">EDI</abbr> Wallets, create government-issued credentials (national ID, driving licence, social security), and update public services to accept wallet-based authentication</li>
          <li><strong>Large online platforms</strong> — platforms with over 45 million <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> users (classified as "very large online platforms" under the Digital Services Act) are required to accept <abbr title="European Digital Identity">EDI</abbr> Wallets for user login and age verification</li>
          <li><strong>Identity-reliant sectors</strong> — banks, insurers, healthcare providers, telecom operators, and any organisation that currently verifies identity through document checks will benefit from integrating wallet-based verification into their onboarding and <abbr title="Know Your Customer">KYC</abbr> processes</li>
          <li><strong>Credential issuers</strong> — universities, professional bodies, employers, and certification authorities need to issue their credentials in verifiable formats compatible with <abbr title="European Digital Identity">EDI</abbr> Wallets</li>
          <li><strong>Technology providers</strong> — identity platforms, <abbr title="Know Your Customer">KYC</abbr> providers, and authentication services need to build wallet-compatible infrastructure and integrate with the eIDAS 2.0 trust framework</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even organisations not directly mandated to accept <abbr title="European Digital Identity">EDI</abbr> Wallets will find strategic value in early adoption. Wallet-based verification reduces <abbr title="Know Your Customer">KYC</abbr> costs, improves user experience, strengthens <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation"><abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr></abbr> compliance through data minimisation, and positions organisations for a future where digital identity credentials are the norm rather than the exception.</p>

      <section id="edi-timeline">
        <h2>What is the timeline for EDI Wallet deployment?</h2>
        <p>The rollout of the <abbr title="European Digital Identity">EDI</abbr> Wallet follows a phased timeline defined by eIDAS 2.0 and the associated implementing acts. Here are the key milestones:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><time datetime="2024-05-20">20 May 2024</time></strong> — eIDAS 2.0 entered into force</li>
          <li><strong><time datetime="2024-11">November 2024</time></strong> — deadline for the European Commission to adopt the first implementing acts specifying technical standards, security requirements, and certification criteria for <abbr title="European Digital Identity">EDI</abbr> Wallets</li>
          <li><strong><time datetime="2023">2023</time>–<time datetime="2025">2025</time></strong> — large-scale pilots under the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Digital Identity Wallet Consortium (POTENTIAL, EWC, NOBID, DC4EU) testing cross-border use cases including travel, education, payments, and government services</li>
          <li><strong>Late <time datetime="2026">2026</time></strong> — member states must issue <abbr title="European Digital Identity">EDI</abbr> Wallets to citizens and residents who request them</li>
          <li><strong><time datetime="2027">2027</time> onwards</strong> — large online platforms must accept <abbr title="European Digital Identity">EDI</abbr> Wallets for authentication (exact date depends on implementing act adoption)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Early preparation is critical.</strong> Organisations that wait for the mandates to take effect will find themselves scrambling to integrate wallet acceptance, redesign onboarding flows, and adapt internal systems. Those that start now — assessing their identity processes, mapping credential flows, and running pilots — will be ready when the wallets go live. The large-scale pilots are already generating real-world learnings that early movers can benefit from.</p>

Our mission is..
Design pioneering solutions that achieve natural, human and urban ecosystem regeneration on a global scale.

Let us tell you why.

Our world is changing, faster and faster. A thousand years ago, we fully submitted to the complex system of nature. Today, our species has taken over the globe and created human and urban ecosystems that are putting increasing pressure on themselves and the natural systems that support it. We are rapidly approaching tipping points that might result in unrepairable damage to our ecosystems, with the survival of humankind on the line, at least in the way we know it today. It is time for a change in how we do things.

We need to move from isolated practices towards a complex system-approach for innovation and
we need to move beyond sustainability towards regeneration.

From isolated practices towards a complex system approach
Social, urban, and environmental challenges are often described as "wicked problems"—complex, interconnected, and unpredictable. Traditional, linear approaches to innovation frequently fall short, sometimes even worsening the situation. A systems approach, however, offers a holistic perspective, acknowledging that changes in one part of a system can have unforeseen impacts on others. This approach embraces complexity, finding strength at the intersection of chaos and order.

A systems approach is vital for addressing issues like climate change, social inequality, and global health crises—problems that span multiple domains and result from intricate interactions among social, environmental, and economic factors. By fostering innovation and collaboration across sectors and disciplines, it breaks down silos that can hinder effective solutions. Considering diverse viewpoints and expertise, this approach leads to more comprehensive, resilient, and regenerative outcomes. Embracing complexity and balancing between chaos and order allows us to better understand and respond to the dynamic challenges of our time.

From sustainability towards regeneration
Sustainability suggests maintaining a balance between the positive and negative impacts of our activities on ecosystems, often aiming for climate neutrality or net-zero strategies. But what if this balance is insufficient? What if we are so out of bounds that we cannot prevent planetary boundaries from beingexceeding the limits set by climate scientists? We already see the consequences—nature is suffering, vast areas are becoming uninhabitable, and species are going extinct. It's a reality many are just beginning to grasp.

Regeneration, on the other hand, seeks not just to maintain balance but to restore, regenerate, and enhance the intrinsic value of ecosystems. It aims for positive feedback loops and the self-organization of systems toward a desired state. Regeneration focuses on human well-being, the restoration of nature and biodiversity, and the creation of livable urban spaces where humans and nature coexist, rather than extracting resources from elsewhere. The concept of regeneration offers a way forward, even in the face of dire predictions. Successful regenerative projects, such as the half-moon ditches dug across the barren Sahel to combat desertification, demonstrate its potential.

Regenerative innovation systems
The idea behind Regenerative Innovation Systems is to foster systems that are inherently resilient, adaptable, and capable of evolving to meet changing needs and challenges. While the concept is relatively new and still under-defined in academic literature, there is a growing body of work on regenerative thinking and business practices. Notably, Carol Sanford has outlined guiding principles, though regenerative innovation systems as a concept require further exploration. However, the concept of regenerative systems is more established in natural, urban, and human ecosystems.

In natural ecosystems, regenerative agriculture has long been a method for growing crops without fertilizers, improving soil health, and increasing yields. In human ecosystems, regeneration is tied to well-being, encompassing not just jobs, homes, and physical health but also community, purpose, and access to nature. Universal basic income is an example of a regenerative solution, showing positive effects on mental and physical health, family relations, job searches, and volunteerism, all while reducing government spending on costly services.

In urban ecosystems, natural and human systems coexist. The challenge is to make both thrive in city environments, creating livable habitats with global impact. Regenerative solutions include local sustainable energy systems, clean mobility, water system optimization, circular resource use, climate resilience, and economic equality. For example, bi-directional charging of shared vehicles helps balance local renewable energy systems, provides clean mobility, reduces the number of parked vehicles, and frees up space for nature to return. Urban regeneration is not only possible but essential.

Regen Studio
At Regen Studio, we choose our projects carefully, accepting only those with potential for regeneration in natural, urban, or human ecosystems. We consider ourselves designers, crafting processes to identify challenges, generate ideas, develop prototypes, validate solutions within ecosystems, and test them in real-life situations. We also aim to contribute to the field by expanding knowledge on regenerative innovation systems.

We don’t work alone. Our expertise lies in bringing people together around a common challenge and providing a clear, concrete path to solving it. We guide you and your innovation ecosystems through the complex process of change, toward solutions that achieve regeneration within our lifetimes and on a global scale.

## Company Background

Regen Studio was founded in 2023 as a regenerative innovation design studio. The company operates from two offices:

- **The Netherlands**: Regen Studio B.V., Berg en Dal (KVK 90337948)
- **Brazil**: Regen Studio Consultoria LTDA, Sao Paulo (CNPJ 57.579.114/0001-55)

Regen Studio is an independent, vendor-neutral advisory firm. It does not sell DPP software or implementation tools. Instead, it helps organisations understand their obligations, assess readiness, design compliance roadmaps, and select appropriate vendors. The studio works at the intersection of EU regulation, circular economy, digital identity, energy transition, and systemic innovation — always with a regenerative lens.

Clients include municipalities, energy cooperatives, startups, NGOs, industry consortia, and enterprises navigating complex regulatory and sustainability transitions.

## Innovation Services (10 Methodologies)

Regen Studio offers 10 innovation design services, each available as a standalone engagement or as part of a custom innovation process:

1. **Problem Analysis** — Find root causes of complex challenges through systems mapping, stakeholder analysis, and causal loop diagrams. Helps organisations understand what they are really trying to solve before jumping to solutions.
2. **Ideation** — Sketch future possibilities using structured creative sessions and divergent thinking. Generates a broad set of potential solutions grounded in the problem analysis.
3. **Prototyping** — Build rough solutions rapidly to test concepts before committing resources. Includes functional prototypes, mockups, and interactive demos.
4. **Solution Validation** — Test prototypes against real-world requirements, stakeholder needs, legal constraints, and technical feasibility. Ensures solutions pass all necessary checks before scaling.
5. **Experiment Design** — Design structured experiments with measurable outcomes to test solutions in practice. Used extensively in living lab contexts.
6. **Design Sprints** — Innovation pressure cooker: compress months of exploration into focused multi-day sessions that move from problem to tested prototype.
7. **Innovation Process Design** — Create a custom innovation framework tailored to an organisation's specific context, governance, procurement rules, and culture. Regen Studio designed the eight-phase innovation process adopted as departmental policy by The Hague's CIO.
8. **Innovation System Design** — Build co-creation communities and multi-stakeholder innovation ecosystems. Design the structures, incentives, and governance that enable collaborative innovation.
9. **Innovation Coaching** — Provide ongoing support to teams navigating innovation journeys. Includes mentoring, facilitation, and strategic guidance.
10. **Innovation Management** — Effective innovation operations: portfolio management, governance, scaling criteria, and organisational learning.

## Key EU Regulations Covered

### ESPR — Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation
The ESPR (Regulation (EU) 2024/1781) replaces the old Ecodesign Directive and extends ecodesign requirements beyond energy-related products to nearly all physical products placed on the EU market. It introduces mandatory Digital Product Passports, performance requirements (durability, reparability, recyclability), substance of concern disclosure, and destruction bans. The ESPR Working Plan 2025-2030 prioritises 22 product groups for delegated acts, starting with textiles, iron and steel, aluminium, furniture, tyres, detergents, and more. Each delegated act will define product-specific DPP data requirements, ecodesign performance thresholds, and compliance timelines.

Regen Studio publishes detailed analyses of the ESPR working plan, individual delegated acts (such as the textiles delegated act), and DPP readiness guidance.

### Construction Products Regulation (CPR) 2024/3110
The recast CPR introduces a Digital Product Passport framework in Chapter X covering 37 product families (from cement and concrete to thermal insulation and geosynthetics). DPP obligations depend on harmonised European standards (hENs) being updated to include sustainability and circularity data points, plus a delegated act specifying DPP format and content. The CPR operates a two-route CE marking system: the harmonised standards route (hENs) and the European Assessment Document route (EAD/ETA) for innovative products. Innovative products using the EAD route may face DPP obligations earlier than mainstream products.

Regen Studio's interactive CPR DPP Tracker covers all 37 product families with standards progress, AVCP systems, estimated DPP readiness ranges, and milestones.

### EU Battery Regulation 2023/1542
The Battery Regulation mandates Digital Product Passports for all batteries placed on the EU market. Battery passports become mandatory from February 2027 for EV batteries, LMT batteries, and industrial batteries above 2 kWh. The passport must include battery chemistry, carbon footprint, recycled content, expected lifetime, and state-of-health data. SLI batteries and portable batteries follow later.

Regen Studio's Battery Passport Checker helps companies determine their specific obligations based on battery type and capacity.

### Toy Safety Regulation 2025/2509
The new Toy Safety Regulation introduces a Digital Product Passport for toys placed on the EU single market. It replaces Directive 2009/48/EC and strengthens chemical safety requirements, adds digital labelling provisions, and mandates traceability through a product passport.

### Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) 2025/40
The PPWR introduces packaging-level Digital Product Passports, mandatory recycled content targets, reuse obligations, and labelling harmonisation. It replaces Directive 94/62/EC and applies to all packaging placed on the EU market.

### Textiles Delegated Act (in preparation)
The first delegated act under the ESPR is expected to cover textiles, with adoption anticipated around late 2026 or early 2027. It will define ecodesign requirements for durability, fibre composition disclosure, microplastic shedding limits, and Digital Product Passport data requirements for garments and textile products.

      <h1>What is eIDAS 2.0?</h1>
      <p class="qa-article__capsule"><strong><dfn>eIDAS 2.0</dfn> (EU Regulation 2024/1183) is the revised European framework for electronic identification and trust services, requiring all EU member states to offer citizens a <dfn>European Digital Identity Wallet</dfn> by <time datetime="2026">2026</time> — the most ambitious digital identity framework in the world.</strong></p>

      <section id="eidas-acronym">
        <h2>What does eIDAS stand for?</h2>
        <p><dfn><abbr title="electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services">eIDAS</abbr></dfn> stands for <strong>electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services</strong>. The original eIDAS Regulation (EU 910/2014) established the legal framework for mutual recognition of electronic identification schemes across EU member states, along with trust services such as electronic signatures, seals, and time stamps.</p>
        <p>eIDAS 2.0 (Regulation (EU) 2024/1183) is the <strong>revision</strong> that amends the original regulation. It was adopted to address the limitations of eIDAS 1.0 — in particular, the low cross-border adoption of national eID schemes and the absence of a citizen-controlled digital identity wallet. The revision introduces the European Digital Identity Wallet, new categories of trust services, and stronger requirements for interoperability across the EU.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="eidas-wallet">
        <h2>What is a European Digital Identity Wallet?</h2>
        <p>The <dfn>European Digital Identity Wallet</dfn> (<abbr title="European Digital Identity Wallet">EUDIW</abbr>) is a mobile application that lets citizens and residents store, manage, and present digital credentials — including national identity documents, driving licences, diplomas, professional qualifications, and health certificates. The wallet puts the individual in control of their data through <strong>selective disclosure</strong>: users decide exactly which attributes to share in any given interaction.</p>
        <p>Key characteristics of the European Digital Identity Wallet:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mandatory availability</strong> — every EU member state must offer at least one wallet to its citizens and residents by <time datetime="2026">2026</time></li>
          <li><strong>Free of charge</strong> — wallets must be free for natural persons</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-border interoperability</strong> — a wallet issued in any member state must be recognised and accepted across the entire EU</li>
          <li><strong>Selective disclosure</strong> — users can prove specific attributes (e.g. being over 18) without revealing their full identity or date of birth</li>
          <li><strong>Architecture and Reference Framework</strong> — the technical specifications are based on the <abbr title="Architecture and Reference Framework">ARF</abbr> developed by the eIDAS Expert Group, ensuring consistent implementation across member states</li>
          <li><strong>High Level of Assurance</strong> — wallets must meet the "high" level of assurance as defined under eIDAS, ensuring robust identity proofing and authentication</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The wallet is designed to work for both online and offline scenarios — from logging into government portals and opening bank accounts to presenting a driving licence during a roadside check or proving professional qualifications to a new employer across borders.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="eidas-vc">
        <h2>What are Verifiable Credentials?</h2>
        <p><dfn>Verifiable Credentials</dfn> are tamper-proof, cryptographically signed digital statements issued by a trusted party. They can represent virtually anything — a university diploma, proof of address, a professional licence, an age attestation, or a company registration certificate. What makes them "verifiable" is that any relying party can independently check the cryptographic proof of authenticity and integrity <strong>without needing to contact the original issuer</strong>.</p>
        <p>The Verifiable Credentials model involves three roles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Issuer</strong> — a trusted entity (university, government, employer) that creates and signs the credential</li>
          <li><strong>Holder</strong> — the individual or organisation that stores the credential in their wallet and decides when and to whom to present it</li>
          <li><strong>Verifier</strong> — the party that requests and checks the credential (e.g. a border agent, bank, or online service)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Verifiable Credentials are based on <strong>W3C standards</strong> (the Verifiable Credentials Data Model) and are a core building block of both eIDAS 2.0 and <a href="#eidas-ssi"><abbr title="Self-Sovereign Identity">SSI</abbr> (Self-Sovereign Identity)</a>. Under eIDAS 2.0, the new <abbr title="Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes">QEAA</abbr> (Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes) trust service provides a legally recognised, high-assurance form of Verifiable Credentials issued by <abbr title="Qualified Trust Service Provider">QTSP</abbr>s.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="eidas-ssi">
        <h2>What is Self-Sovereign Identity?</h2>
        <p><dfn><abbr title="Self-Sovereign Identity">SSI</abbr> (Self-Sovereign Identity)</dfn> is a model where individuals own and control their digital identity <strong>without depending on a central authority</strong>. Instead of relying on a platform, government database, or identity provider to mediate access to personal data, SSI puts the individual at the centre of every identity interaction.</p>
        <p>SSI is built on two complementary technologies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><dfn><abbr title="Decentralized Identifier">DID</abbr>s (Decentralized Identifiers)</dfn></strong> — globally unique identifiers that individuals create and control themselves, without needing a centralised registration authority. DIDs can be resolved to cryptographic keys and service endpoints, enabling secure, peer-to-peer communication.</li>
          <li><strong>Verifiable Credentials</strong> — cryptographically signed digital attestations that can be stored in a wallet, selectively disclosed, and independently verified (see <a href="#eidas-vc">the section above</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The practical result is that people can <strong>prove claims</strong> — such as their age, qualifications, citizenship, or employment status — <strong>without revealing more information than necessary</strong>. This principle of <strong>data minimisation</strong> aligns directly with the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and is central to the privacy-by-design approach.</p>
        <p>eIDAS 2.0 incorporates SSI principles into EU law. The European Digital Identity Wallet is, in effect, an SSI wallet with legal standing across the entire EU — combining the decentralised, user-controlled model of SSI with the legal certainty and cross-border recognition of EU regulation. Read more in our <a href="../blog/ssi-privacy/">blog on SSI and privacy</a>.</p>

      <section id="eidas-dpp">
        <h2>How does eIDAS 2.0 relate to Digital Product Passports?</h2>
        <p><a href="../what-is-a-digital-product-passport/"><abbr title="Digital Product Passport">DPP</abbr>s (Digital Product Passports)</a> and eIDAS 2.0 address different domains — product information and digital identity — but they intersect at a critical point: <strong>trust</strong>. <abbr title="Digital Product Passport">DPP</abbr> data is only as reliable as the identity of the economic operators and supply chain actors who created, verified, and attested it.</p>
        <p>The connection works in several ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Trusted identity for economic operators</strong> — manufacturers, importers, and conformity assessment bodies need verifiable, cross-border identity to sign declarations of performance, conformity certificates, and DPP data entries</li>
          <li><strong>Business credentials in wallets</strong> — eIDAS 2.0 wallets can carry organisational credentials such as company registrations, <abbr title="Legal Entity Identifier">LEI</abbr> attestations, trade licences, and sector-specific authorisations</li>
          <li><strong>Data integrity through qualified trust services</strong> — Qualified Electronic Seals and Qualified Time Stamps from eIDAS 2.0 can ensure that DPP data has not been tampered with and can be traced to a verified source</li>
          <li><strong>Supply chain verification</strong> — each actor in a supply chain can use wallet-based credentials to prove their identity and authorisations when contributing data to a DPP</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Regen Studio wrote the <a href="../blog/trusted-dpps/">Trusted <abbr title="Digital Product Passport">DPP</abbr> position paper</a> for <abbr title="Future Identity Data Ethics Standards">FIDES</abbr> and the Dutch Blockchain Coalition, exploring exactly how eIDAS 2.0 and <abbr title="Digital Product Passport">DPP</abbr> infrastructure should converge to create trustworthy product data ecosystems. The <a href="https://demos.regenstudio.world" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><abbr title="European Digital Identity">EDI</abbr> Wallet demo</a> illustrates these concepts in practice.</p>

        <h2>What are Qualified Trust Services under eIDAS 2.0?</h2>
        <p>Qualified Trust Services are the legally recognised, high-assurance services that underpin digital transactions across the EU. Under eIDAS 2.0, the list of qualified trust services has been expanded to include new categories that support the wallet ecosystem and modern digital workflows.</p>
        <p>The full set of Qualified Trust Services under eIDAS 2.0:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><abbr title="Qualified Electronic Signature">QES</abbr> (Qualified Electronic Signatures)</strong> — the digital equivalent of a handwritten signature, with the highest legal standing in the EU. Can be created using the wallet.</li>
          <li><strong>Qualified Electronic Seals</strong> — used by organisations (legal persons) to guarantee the origin and integrity of documents and data</li>
          <li><strong>Qualified Time Stamps</strong> — cryptographic proof that data existed at a specific point in time</li>
          <li><strong><abbr title="Qualified Website Authentication Certificate">QWAC</abbr>s (Qualified Website Authentication Certificates)</strong> — certificates that verify the identity of websites, providing users with assurance about who operates a site</li>
          <li><strong><dfn><abbr title="Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes">QEAA</abbr> (Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes)</dfn></strong> — <strong>new in eIDAS 2.0</strong>. Legally recognised attestations about a person's or organisation's attributes (qualifications, authorisations, memberships), issued by <abbr title="Qualified Trust Service Provider">QTSP</abbr>s and presentable through the wallet</li>
          <li><strong>Electronic Archiving</strong> — qualified services for long-term preservation of electronic documents and data, ensuring their integrity over time</li>
          <li><strong>Electronic Ledgers</strong> — <strong>new in eIDAS 2.0</strong>. Qualified services for recording data in a tamper-evident, chronologically ordered sequence</li>
        </ul>
        <p><dfn><abbr title="Qualified Trust Service Provider">QTSP</abbr>s (Qualified Trust Service Providers)</dfn> must meet strict security, audit, and supervisory requirements set by their national supervisory body. They undergo regular conformity assessments and are listed on the <strong>EU Trusted List</strong>, making their status verifiable across all member states. The addition of QEAA is particularly significant — it provides the legal basis for high-assurance digital credentials in wallets, bridging the gap between technical Verifiable Credentials and legally binding attestations.</p>
